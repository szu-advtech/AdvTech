# tasks file for vagrant-nettwork-config
#This task removes the nat adapter used by the vagrant environment
#This way we have a clean networking namespace on each virtual machine
#The virtual machine's networking is made up by only an interface bridged to a physical interface on the host.

#remove the netplan files already configured by vagrant
- name: Find and save in a local variable all the netplan configuration files
  find:
    paths: /etc/netplan
    patterns: "*.yaml"
  register: files_to_delete

- name: Delete all the netplan configuration files
  file:
    path: "{{ item.path }}"
    state: absent
  with_items: "{{ files_to_delete.files }}"

#copy the new configuration file which configures the bridge adapter with dhcp and assigning also a static ip. Netplan does not allow to assign an static ip and
#use the dhcp to get the routing information
#probably in different environments the interface name has to be changed. check your host OS and adjust the template file accordingly
