what is a method to detect thermal oxide layer after steel is painted ? <eos> is there a method to test for thermal oxide on a painted steel part after the paint has cured ? i 'd rather the method be nondestructive but it only being destructive in the presence of thermal oxide is also acceptable . i am specifically looking for laser oxide under 3mils of polyurethane , if that helps .
can the fine-tuning problem be finessed out of existence via the multi-verse ? <eos> the standard model has a number of constants whose specific values are under scrutiny . the fine-tuning problem is that these constants must be a very narrow range for the universe to exist in a real sense - ie the creation of stars and galaxies . one aspect of the multiverse theory is to determine some or all them via a darwinian process . the hope is that this will both reduce the number of constants , and also drive the constants to the range required . the best it that it can do is to reduce the number of constants to one . but surely then the fine-tuning problem still exists , in that this one constant carries the probability ( tending to certainty ) that a universe with our constants ( that is our universe ) can emerge ?
does the berkeleydb-based wallet.dat implementation leak private key data ? <eos> i read this little nugget on the bitcoin client bug tracker : the bdb binary log files can also contain sensitive data such as private keys is that true ? does this mean that even with an encrypted wallet.dat , there might be a way that the private keys are written to disk unprotected ? if so , what can i do about it ?

hand distribution in DIGIT max vs full ring <eos> i have heard that the distribution in a DIGIT max game is similar to that of a DIGIT or DIGIT handed game where the extra players have folded . i am wondering how true that is . seems like there may be a higher probability of high cards in the remaining players hands and in the deck in the latter case since some players have folded . my assumption here is that if they ( the players that folded ) had a higher than normal amount of high cards , then it would be more likely that someone had opened .

what seasonal work can fund travel ? <eos> i 'm fond of the travel strategy that involves arriving at a workplace near your destination and doing seasonal labor until you 've saved enough to have fun in and around the same geographical area . the archetypal way of doing this is to get a job at an alaskan cannery or fishing operation and process seafood for a season and then you 've got your expenses and flight home paid for , plus some money to burn running around alaska , skiing , rafting , camping , etc . what i want to know , is what other similar scenarios exist where there is a ready , high-turnover job market located in a part of the world where i can also get my tourist jollies .
zero divisors in $ su_q ( 2 ) $ <eos> i 'm looking at the quantum group $ su_q ( 2 ) $ ( over $ { mathbb c } $ ) and ca n't see why it has no zero divisors . it 's clear that $ m_q ( 2 ) $ , the quantum $ 2 times 2 $ matrices have no zero divisors , but i ca n't seem to see why/if this extends to the quotient over $ det_q - 1 $ . i think one can argue it from the grading on $ m_q ( 2 ) $ , but that 's just a guess .

how did the portuguese pronoun `` se '' take on these other functions ? <eos> in portuguese , the third person accusative pronoun se ( `` himself/herself/itself/themselves '' ) can be used for four different purposes : 1 . ) most straightforwardly , as a reflexive pronoun : mantém-se forte keeps-himself strong `` he keeps himself strong '' 2 . ) as a reciprocal marker : amam-se love-themselves `` they love each other '' 3 . ) as a particle for subject indetermination : vive-se bem neste país lives-oneself well in this country `` one lives well in this country '' 4 . ) as a passivizing particle : vende-se esta casa sells-itself this house `` this house is being sold '' how did this pronoun develop to fulfil such different functions ? also , is this unique to portuguese or has it occurred in other languages as well ?
systematic all-in <eos> this is a theoretical question , following what i have seen in some low blinds cash games . you generally can not buy-in more than 100bb . say at some point , you reached 10,000 bb . all you adversaries have about 100bb : how good is to go all-in on each hand ? my guess is that it 's bad , but how bad ? i would be interested in seeing the probability study behind this . maybe this can be found somewhere ? it should depend on the number of opponents , the hand odd , etc . for instance , with a stack k times bigger than the average stack of your opponents , what it is the expected number of hands you can play all-in preflop before your stack hits 0 ?

can breaststroke be harmful for the back ? <eos> i heard many contradictory things related to the harm breaststroke can do to the back . ( all during informal discussions . i have no references to include here , so my question ) . some say swimming can only be good for the back and the rest of the body some other say that breaststroke can be deleterious for the back , even if the swimmer submerges his/her head .

why do dogs turn around in a circle before lying down ? <eos> i have observed over and over again in dogs ( mine and others ) that they will often walk around in a little circle , on the spot , where they are about to lie down . it 's like they need to rotate a certain number of times before it 's ok to lie down and curl up in a ball . i have also noticed that they will only tend to do this , if they are going to curl up in a ball to sleep . why do dogs often turn around in a circle before lying down ? and is it connected to them wanting to sleep curled up ?

can a rigid-prop quadcopter hover upside-down ? <eos> most small quadcopters use rigid rotors with some fixed pitch . in principle , i can imagine it might be possible for such a rigid-prop quadcopter to hover upside-down , but that apparently requires reversing the direction of rotation of all DIGIT motors . ( this is very different from the way some `` standard '' single-rotor model helicopters can hover upside-down by continuing to spin that rotor in `` the same direction '' , but moving the swash plate to give negative blade pitch ) . is it possible for a rigid-prop quadcopter to hover upside-down ? when i build a quadcopter so it can switch from flying upright to flying upside-down and back again in mid-flight , what do i do differently than a normal quadcopter designed to always fly right-side-up ?

should i use matches or a refillable lighter ? <eos> to light my gas stove , i use either a cheap butane lighter or small sulphur matches . the lighter is refillable and made of plastic , and the matches are made of wood and come in small cardboard boxes . i compost the used matches . is there much of a difference as far as greenhouse gas emissions go ? is there obvious environmental concerns with one or the other ? edit : i assume the stove could probably be lit with a simple spark . the lighter would be refilled with butane from a butane can , which originates from fossil fuel ( as i understand , either from natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas ) .
are motion activated faucets more sustainable than traditional faucets ? <eos> in the spirit of this question about paper towels vs electric dryers , which types of faucets are most sustainable ? the marketing reasons for using motion-activated faucets are that they reduce water usage , and since they do n't need to be touched , require less time and chemicals for cleaning . however , they do require electricity and motors , and when ( as often happens ) the motion activation part is n't working well , people touch them anyway ( or hit them , grab them , squeeze them , etc , as they grow more and more frustrated ( not that i would know anything about that ... ) ) . it seems like something with a bumper ( like many drinking fountains ) or a foot pedal would offer the best of both worlds .

does entropy apply to newton 's first law or does `` acted upon '' always require an external factor ? <eos> first law : every body remains in a state of rest or uniform motion ( constant velocity ) unless it is acted upon by an external unbalanced force . this means that in the absence of a non-zero net force , the center of mass of a body either remains at rest , or moves at a constant speed in a straight line . wikipedia & mdash ; newton 's laws of motion does n't the law of increasing entropy affect all objects though , since they are all in the closed system of the universe at large , and therefore they are all subject to slowing down , regardless of the containing medium , given enough time ? i guess what i 'm curious is , can there ever be a body that will remain at uniform motion or uniform rest given that entropy must increase ?

( 2010 ) : male breast cancer accounts for less than DIGIT of all cancers in men and less than DIGIT of breast cancers . this raises the question : why do most breast cancers occur in women ? two plausible explanations i can think of : a male is less likely to get breast cancer for anatomical reasons ( such as a smaller quantity of breast tissue , or breast tissue that is less susceptible to cancer ) , women have higher significantly levels of estrogen , which is linked to mutations that cause breast cancer ( see cavalieria et al . ( 2006 ) ) . although , i have no evidence to suggest that either of these is predominant factor .

dc motor pid control with unstable velocity feedback <eos> currently i am building a omnidirectional robot with DIGIT dc motors with embedded incremental encoder . however , with a constant pwm input , i am not able to control the motor to rotate in a `` relatively stable '' state , refer to the figure , it can be observed that the linear speed of the motors can varied in 10cm/s range . i believe one possible reason is the pwm signal generated from my arduino mega controller is not good enough . and my problem is how can i implement a stable pid controller in this case ? as the speed of the motor varies even with the same input , i believe extra work like adding a filter is needed ? any advice is appreciated > . & lt ; thank you

error in estimating the size of a set ? <eos> suppose we have a set a and a subset b. if we know |a| , then we can calculate |b| by finding the probability p that an element chosen uniformly at random from a belongs to b. specifically |a|p=|b| . suppose we generate n elements of a uniformly at random and use this data to estimate p ( number of elements in b divided by n ) and hence estimate |b| . how reliable is this estimate ? i.e . how can we compute the error ? as a side question , is there a name for this technique ?

how should one handle an unnecessary question ? <eos> a fairly common experience is that a colleague or subordinate will ask a question ( in person , email , phone , etc ) that would have been answered if they would have properly read all the correspondence , accessed the electronic systems , etc that they already know about as clear parts of their expected workflow . when answering it is tempting to point out that the answer could have been found on their own , and one could argue that this helps train them for the future . on the other hand , i feel it is disrespectful to answer in that way and i would not want it done to me if i would make a similar mistake and would appreciate if the person would just answer the question in a respectful way . what is the best way to handle this ?

how to recycle almond shells ? <eos> i have seen this related question - but it was about the almond peels and not their shells : how do i recycle these ? my relatives advised me to burn it all up , as it drives away mosquitoes [ citation needed ] . others said to just bury it into the soil and it will compost itself away , but i doubt if this will ever happen ( as these are hard shells ) . powdering these shells came to my mind , but i do n't know what to do with the powder either ( and if my mixer grinder can sustain those hard shells in the first place ) . the thing is that i have nearly a kilogram of these almond shells , so i want them to the best use . thank you for your suggestions !

lee and saez ( 2012 ) : pareto-improvement ? <eos> i 'm interested in the following quote that came up in this earlier answer . second , when labor supply responses are along the extensive margin only , which is the empirically relevant case , the co-existence of a minimum wage with a positive tax rate on low-skilled work is always ( second-best ) pareto inefficient.a pareto improving policy consists of reducing the pre-tax minimum wage while keeping constant the post-tax minimum wage by increasing transfers to low-skilled workers , and financing this reform by increasing taxes on higher paid workers . importantly , this result is true whether or not rationing induced by the minimum wage is efficient or not . how are higher paid workers not worse off , given the increased taxes they have to pay ?
has the us congress 's power to declare war been rendered superfluous by recent conflicts ? <eos> after the japanese attacked pearl harbor , the congress of the united states formally declared war on japan . after germany declared war on the united states , the congress then formally declared war on germany . however for all subsequent conflicts that the united states has been involved ( korea , vietnam , grenada , somalia , iraq , afghanistan ) , there has been no formal declaration of war . instead , these conflicts have been justified as un police actions , un peacekeeping activities , requests by local governments , security threats , etc . congress has passed resolutions but no declarations . it now appears that the position of the president as commander-in-chief of the armed forces has usurped the power of congress to control whether the us goes to war or not .

why do national governments not rent money from central banks directly ? <eos> the central bank gives money to the business banks , who then give that money to people , companies and government agencies/units . when a government controls the central bank , why does n't the government lend money from it instead of business banks ? that way they would have : a lower interest rate control on their interest rate theoritically no limit etc . edit : my question is only about where the government gets the money . i 'm not suggesting that the central bank should lend money directly to people or companies .
fusion of gnss position data and prefused 9-dof ahrs data <eos> bosch , freescale , invensense , st and maybe others are releasing 9-dof ahrs platforms containing their own fusion software and outputting filtered/sane/fused data ( attitude as quaternion and linear acceleration ) . i would like to use these for the quality of their respective company fusion algorithm . and would like to merge gnss position and velocity data to it . i have found multiple examples of heavy ( > 20 ) states kalman filters merging raw 9-dof imu data and gnss position/velocity . but i have a hard time finding a computationally lighter version of gps+ahrs fusion as these new 9-dof ahrs already fuse imu raw data themselves and this process should'nt be done twice . would you maybe have pointers on the algorithm ( s ) or type of filter to use ? thank you .

can we show a language is not computably enumerable by showing there is no verifier for it ? <eos> one of the definitions of a computably enumerable ( c.e. , equivalent to recursively enumerable , equivalent to semidecidable ) set is the following : $ a subseteq sigma^* $ is c.e . iff there is a decidable language $ vsubseteq sigma^* $ ( called verifier ) s.t . for all $ xin sigma^* $ , $ xin a $ iff there exists a $ yinsigma^* $ s.t . $ langle x , y rangle in v $ . so one way to show that a language is not c.e . is to show that there is no decidable verifier $ v $ for it . is this method useful to show that languages are not c.e . in practice ?

how many polygons in a scene can modern hardware reach while maintaining realtime , and how to get there ? <eos> a fairly basic , in some ways , question , but one that many people , myself included , do n't really know the answer to . gpu manufacturers often cite extremely high numbers , and the spread between polygon counts that various game engines claim to support often spans multiple orders of magnitude , and then still depends heavily on a lot of variables . i 'm aware that this is a broad , pretty much open-ended question , and i apologize for that , i just thought that it would be a valuable question to have on here nonetheless .

what determines the optimal number of balls between races in a bearing ? <eos> imagine i have an important axle in the gearbox of a motor . i want to support it with ordinary ball bearings at several places along its length . i need both the outer and inner races to stay at fixed diameters at a fixed distance from each other . however , i can change the number of balls in between the races . i can choose any number of different bearings ( though each one has to have a certain diameter , so there 's actually a limit ) . i could squeeze an arbitrary number in , so long as that number is below the maximum and can still support the inner and outer rings . what determines the optimal number of balls used ?

why have converging runways ? <eos> this is ramstein air base in germany , why would you want to have runways converging ( or diverging ) like that , does n't seem to do you much good in terms of parallel usage ( either the approach , or the go-around would be exciting ) . the only reason i can think of is that it gives you more separation when launching aircraft in rapid succession , but then again only in one direction . and it 's not like the military would bother much with separation anyway when there 's a & ndash ; shall we say & ndash ; pressing reason to get in the air fast .

fragment shader 's output variables <eos> edit : this is a duplicate of a question from stack overflow : URL if you want to send a value from vertex shader to fragment shader , the vertex shader should declare one variable as out , the fragment shader should declare other variable as in and both variables must have their names and types equal . but this does n't happen when you want to send the color value from the fragment shader . in fact , you can call the output variable as you want . why ? in older version there was one variable called gl_fragcolor how the program links your output fragment variable with gl_fragcolor ?
alternatives to command line unzip ? <eos> i 've found that the command line unzip tool does n't gracefully handle some of the files i 'm unzipping : it makes a bunch of junk directories , and creates files whose resource forks are n't found .

what approaches are there for stress testing a portfolio ? <eos> wikipedia lists three of them : extreme event : hypothesize the portfolio 's return given the recurrence of a historical event . current positions and risk exposures are combined with the historical factor returns . risk factor shock : shock any factor in the chosen risk model by a user-specified amount . the factor exposures remain unchanged , while the covariance matrix is used to adjust the factor returns based on their correlation with the shocked factor . external factor shock : instead of a risk factor , shock any index , macro-economic series ( e.g. , oil prices ) , or custom series ( e.g. , exchange rates ) . using regression analysis , new factor returns are estimated as a result of the shock . but i was wondering if there is a more comprehensive list .

what are the challenges in predicting lithology directly from acoustic impedance ? <eos> seismic inversion methods help to visualize the subsurface layers of the earth in terms of petrophysical properties ( e.g . impedance ) . still some geophysicists use the final inverted impedance model in company with various seismic attributes ( like amplitude envelope , instantaneous frequency , and phase ) to predict lithology or paleogeographic features . if seismic inversion transforms the reflection amplitude into acoustic impedance ( lithology ) than why ca n't it be used to predict the lithology independently ?

problem of induction without i.i.d <eos> in this paper of aaronson 's , a proof is given of occam 's razor by appealing to pac learning . my understanding of valiant 's bounds for pac learners is that it requires i.i.d . this is often a reasonable assumption to make . however , he used this proof of occam 's razor to justify the problem of induction ( i.e . claim that the future will represent the past ) . if you assume that the future and past data are drawn from the same distribution ( which is how i think i.i.d . is being used ) , this strikes me as essentially assuming that the future will be similar to the past , so using pac learning here begs the question . am i misunderstanding the use of i.i.d. ? is there a way around this problem ?

what might happen if the fed stopped paying interest on excess reserves ? <eos> i am curious to hear what economists think might happen if the fed stopped paying interest on reserves held in excess of the penalty free upper bound . i am also curious to know how economists think this practice might be fazed out gradually in such a way that the fed could mitigate the negative effects that might accompany a sudden and complete cessation of the practice . for example - if banks stop earning risk-free profit on these reserves ( current at DIGIT percent , i think ) would they feel compelled to channel these excess funds into profitable loans ? perhaps this is a way the fed could keep interest rates low after ending qe practices ? would ending the interest payments overnight cause banks to start lending such that we would experience significant inflation ? any feedback , papers , etc . much appreciated !
testing for iron-gall inks <eos> i have to bottles of lamy blue-black fountain pen ink . it turns out that some months ago the composition of the ink was changed by the manufacturer and there is no difference in the package . before , this ink used to contain iron-gall . which makes the ink more permanent ( old inks contained most of the times iron-gall ) . as iron-gall is an oxidizer , it has been removed from the ink because it can damage the pens if not cleaned regularly . i do n't know much about chemistry and i wonder if any of you could tell me a way to know if my ink has iron-gall and therefore is safe for long lifespan documents . i was wondering if litmus paper would do the trick comparing this ink with normal black ink ( which does not have iron-gall ) .

is denying login after incorrect attempts ineffective ? <eos> generally denying login attempts after x amounts of incorrect attempts for y amount of tries is a very basic way to prevent bruteforce attempts or malicious login attempts . yet , surely doing this is meaningless if you allow successful login with the correct password ? in which case getting an error or a warning message about a timeout period when trying an incorrect message is meaningless if the correct password will work regardless . on hotmail for example when i attempt to login with the wrong password i eventually get a message saying further login attempts are restricted . trying with the correct password lets me in straight away . so i wonder if there is any point to having such a warning in the first place ? is it effective in the actual password grants access ?
bcs theory , richardson model and superconductivity <eos> i 'm studying richardson model in second quantization . there are many initial points that i do n't understand : we supposed that an attractive force between DIGIT electrons exists , due to electron-phonon interaction : an electron generates a phonon that is absorbed by the other electron , and we prove that the resulting potential is attractive . but is this really stronger than the coulomb repulsive potential ? how can one estimate this ? why does it neglect the attractive force between electrons with opposite spin ? ( $ pm $ ) they have an opposite magnetic momentum too ... why do we only consider the attractions between electrons with opposite spin ? why do we suppose $ k_f ~r ~ll ~1 $ , where $ k_f $ is ( fermi momentum ) / $ hbar $ , and $ r $ the interaction distance ?

is there an upper bound on the gauge group rank in f-theory compactifications on cy 4-folds ? <eos> it is known that in f-theory compactifications on cy 4-folds one can get gauge groups with very large ranks . the largest single factor* gauge group for compact cy 4-folds i found in the literature is the mind-blowing so ( 7232 ) in this paper : URL . one can imagine that there exist 4d compactifications of f-theory , which do n't have heterotic duals , with gauge groups that are even bigger in rank . now , my question is whether there exists an upper bound on the ranks of single factors* in product gauge groups in either f-theory compactifications on cy 4-folds or in g2 holonomy compactifications of m-theory ? an order of magnitude answer , if known , would be good enough : ) .

has a parody of a work of literature ever become more successful than the original work ? <eos> i was thinking of this when i read nineteen-neighty-four , a fanfic with my little pony ponies in a 1984-ish world . parodies can be really successful as a way of challenging another work , or the ideas in it . if they 're well done , they might also stand on their own as an original work and the one they parodied might be lost in history . works that challenged another 's work is for example august strindberg 's response to ibsen 's a doll 's house . has a parody of a work of literature ever become more successful than the original work ?

are there many links from ancient philosophers to quantum mechanics ? <eos> after doing some research on heraclitus , i noticed that a few of his views are very compatible with quantum mechanics . for example , he is paraphrased as writing : into the same river we both step and do not step . we both are and are not . based off my limited knowledge of quantum mechanics , this can be viewed as somewhat compatible with superposition , in that the metaphorical river holds multiple states at once . are there any more such links between ancient philosophers and quantum mechanics ? ( or more links in heraclitus ' works )

bitcoins & somalia <eos> minneapolis has a large community of immigrants from somalia . they have been accustomed to sending money to relatives there . one person among them sent money to a terrorist organization that had an agent in somalia . seemingly in response to that incident , local banks , fearing liability , stopped providing the service of wiring money to somalia . one person abused the system , so it 's made unavailable to everyone . could bitcoins be used instead ? could that service be quickly made available to the somalis ? e.g. , how much access to the internet in somalia would be needed ? would it be sufficient for those who were in the business of receiving wire-transfers there to have internet access ? what liability issues might arise for those who inform those in need of this system of how to do it ?

is quantum field theory defined by its lattice regularization ? <eos> one statement i 've heard many times is that qft is `` defined '' by the lattice , or that the `` only '' definition of qft is on the lattice ( when such definition exists , e.g in pure yang-mills theory ) . i 've heard that from many people i respect , but i have my doubts . specifically - the lattice is an algorithmic definition of those quantities that can be calculated in euclidean spacetime . as i said in my answer to this question , this is a proper subset of all physical quantities you may be interested in calculating in general , and many physical situations do not have euclidean formulation . is there some response to this objection i am missing , or am i being naive somehow ?

if copper has started to corrode , can it stop ? <eos> i 've recently obtained a couple of electronics units which have suffered corrosion on their copper inductor coils . they were operated in conditions of intense humidity/heat and were placed near the sea . this has resulted in the complete failure in one of these units , where the inductor has come apart due to being eaten away by corrosion , and the other coil shows noticeable amounts of corrosion ( patina present ) . if i were to operate the latter device in a more forgiving environment ( ie : putting a filter in front of it in an air conditioned room ) will the copper continue to corrode regardless or will the oxide layer stop spreading further ?

is there count/mass distinction in european portuguese as it is in english ? <eos> it is said that european portuguese has count/mass distinction as many indo-european languages . however i noticed out that all products/items at stores in portugal are labeled in singular form . in european portuguese although countable nouns are used plural in a sentence like `` i bought apples '' as in english , they appear in the form of bare singular nominal on a price tag . hence , it is possible to see a price tag `` maçã/kg '' rather than `` maçãs/kg '' for the apples at the supermarkets in portugal . i have seen plural tags for such items so far in all languages where there is count/mass distinction except european portuguese . why is there such use of bare nominals in european portuguese which sounds incompatible with sentential meaning ?
how do rossby waves in the ocean form ? <eos> so on land , i believe that one factor in their formation is due to inhomogeneities in surface heating between land and ocean ( and also inhomogeneities in surface heating due to terrain effects like the rocky mountains ) . but what about in the ocean , where we do n't see such inhomogeneities ? how is the formation and movement of rossby waves in ocean different from that of land ?
two subunits connected by only one disulfide bridge : quaternary structure ? <eos> i 've always simply assumed quaternary structure to be characterized by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding , van der waals interactions and whatnot . however , if two distinct polypeptides were only connected by one covalent disulfide bridge , would this be considered as quaternary structure , assuming that non-covalent interactions between the subunits are either negligible or even repulsive ? in other words , can a disulfide bridge , on its own , convey quaternary structure ? on a side note , are there any notable examples of this type of interaction ?
did any specific philosophy contribute to the world wars ? <eos> i understand how , for example , nationalism and imperialism can be said to have been causes/contributing factors behind world war DIGIT and how the great depression was a cause behind world war DIGIT are there any theories on how the philosophical environments in europe ( or the world ) in some way can be said to have contributed to the wars ? has it , for example , ever been argued that existentialism was a contributing cause ? was there , for example , a greater belief in the capabilities of man ? please note that i am not asking about how the world wars changed philosophy .

how does the kinect device work ? <eos> some explanations of the device base it on a simple echo of light : `` the camera transmits invisible near-infrared light and measures its “ time of flight ” after it reflects off the objects . time-of-flight works like sonar : if you know how long the light takes to return , you know how far away an object is . '' ( wired.com ) . is it so easy ? on other hand , the developers , primesense , speak about `` a sophisticated parallel computational algorithm to decipher the received light coding '' . and they claim to avoid noise from ambiance light and to be able to obtain a resolution of 1cm at DIGIT meters . a motivation to ask this here in physics is that some other questions were asking for measurement of light speed with household devices .

when lasers are used to cool atoms or ions , etc where does the heat go ? <eos> according to the first law of thermodynamics , sourced from wikipedia `` in any process in an isolated system , the total energy remains the same . '' so when lasers are used for cooling in traps , similar to the description here : URL where is the heat transferred ? from what i gather of a cursory reading on traps , whether laser , magnetic , etc the general idea is to isolate the target , then transfer heat from it , thereby cooling it . i do n't understand how sending photons at a ( n ) atom ( s ) can cause that structure to shed energy , and this mechanism seems to be the key to these systems .
what are the technologies used in a320 autopilot ? <eos> in the newest aircraft , autopilots are of paramount importance , but how are they designed ? what is the hardware used to run them ( i guess it is quite different from my laptop ) ? what is the software ( language ) used and what are its characteristics ( regular clock counter , robust , ... ) ? this question concerns mainly civil aircraft since i guess that it will be hard to get answers for military ones ! edit to make this question answerable and less broad , i would like to have answers focusing on turbojet engine aircraft used as civilian carriers ( a320 seems a good candidate to me but i am opened to any other airplane fitting the description ) .

why do n't pilots always use autoland ? <eos> in aeroplanes that are equipped for autoland and landing at an airport with a working and adequate instrument landing system for the conditions , why would a pilot choose not to use autoland ? if i had to guess , i 'd say it 's due to some of the following : autoland is stressful and labour-intensive for pilots compared with flying the plane normally down to the ground in vmc . autoland produces less comfortable or otherwise `` worse '' quality landings . using autoland is less fun or enjoyable for the pilots . the use of autoland is restricted by aviation regulations . but i do n't have any sources to back up these claims .
what tendencies should i be looking out for and how can i use that information to my benefit ? <eos> i see a lot of poker strategy sites , forums , etc . saying that you should be observing your opponents at the poker table - and understandably so . but what sort of tendencies should i be specifically looking out for ? players who limp monsters , overbetting the pot when a flush rivers , 3-betting the button with mediocre hands like suited connectors , etc. ? and , with that said , how can i use that information to best benefit myself at the table and give myself a bigger edge ?

practical examples of fair division algorithms being used <eos> consider the problem of fairly sharing a homogeneous cake between two people . it is well-known that a fair division can be achieved through the divide and choose procedure : player DIGIT cuts the cake into two pieces and player DIGIT chooses a piece . this problem can be generalized to non-homogeneous cake , more than two players , etc . my question is : are there any concrete examples of people using the fair division procedures ( such as divide and choose ) that emerge as the solution to such problems in practical applications ?
how can parents avoid their child becoming a `` whiner '' ? <eos> inspired from my previous question , but distilled to be more specific : what types of parenting would cause a child to become a `` whiner ? '' by this , i mean that the child becomes someone who tends to use complaining to authority figures ( exaggerating the difficulties s/he is facing ) as the first choice for resolving problems . where i come from , the `` common wisdom '' seems to be that comforting a child for things that `` should n't '' require comfort ( like minor pain from bumping one 's head ) encourages this behavior , and that the preferred method is to not `` give in '' to the child 's cries for attention . is this true ?

why are there only a finite number of sporadic simple groups ? <eos> is there any overarching reason why , after excluding the infinite classes of finite simple groups ( cyclic , alternating , lie-type ) , what remains -- -the sporadic , exceptional finite simple groups , is in fact a finite list ( just 26 ) ? in some sense , the prime numbers can be viewed as `` sporadic , '' but there is an infinite supply . is there some principle that indicates that there must be only a finite number of these exceptional groups , and the `` only issue '' ( to minimize a huge , multi-year community effort ) was to identify them ? i ask in relative ignorance of modern group theory , and apologize in advance for the naiveness of my question .

how can i book deck ferry tickets from piraeus , athens to naxos ? <eos> a group of friends is travelling to greece soon and wants to take a ferry from piraeus , athens to the island of naxos . they 've tried to book tickets through URL ( which uses seretis travel ) but it appears that they only allow you to get tickets for a cabin -- you can either book the whole cabin or split by gender into separate cabins . they 're a mixed group so this is undesirable , plus they want to be out on the deck anyways ( and it 's cheaper ) . is there anywhere online where they can book deck tickets ? has anyone else had experience with this or other nearby ferry trips ? is it easy to get tickets on location if they ca n't book online , or will they sell out days beforehand ? any other concerns ?
how to get friends to take me seriously ? <eos> usually , i come across as someone who often makes jokes and not very serious about things in my life . however , this has resulted in my friends not taking me seriously even when i want to tell them a serious issue . how do i change this when the impression of me has already been fixed in their minds ? for example when i tell them a plan for a group project or , like maybe not to disturb me while i do my work , they will jokingly dismiss me and continue with what they are doing because they assume i am joking with them as well and when i put on a serious face , they will just find it funny and this annoys me to the core .
measuring the performance and response rate of escs <eos> how would i go about measuring and quantifying the performance of an esc ? i am looking to measure the response rate ( in hz ) of an esc , as well as it 's performance ( i.e how fast it starts and stops , as well as how much it increases/decreases the motor 's speed per tick ) . i 'm assuming that i can manually program an esc and it 's response rate with a programming card/module that is compatible with said esc , but i would still not be able to measure the exact performance of the esc . i would appreciate any and all inputs and suggestions . p.s this question is linked/asked in conjunction with a previous question of mine here on the robotics stackexchange here why can & # 39 ; t i use different escs together on a multirotor ?
phone calls over headphone jack ? <eos> i 'm looking at buying a new car . many of the cars i see now come `` standard '' with an audio-in jack . the option of a bluetooth connection is usually much more expensive . my question is : if i plug my phone into the audio-in jack with a cable to the headphones port , can i use the phone `` handsfree '' effectively while operating the vehicle ? that is , will the incoming sound come over the speakers , and not echo hopelessly into the input on the phone itself ? or do i basically have to spring for the bluetooth , either at purchase time or aftermarket ?

are there any computational models of mirror neurons ? <eos> from wikipedia : a mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another . mirror neurons are related to imitation learning , a very useful feature that is missing in current real-world a.i . implementations . instead of learning from input-output examples ( supervised learning ) or from rewards ( reinforcement learning ) , an agent with mirror neurons would be able to learn by simply observing other agents , translating their movements to its own coordinate system . what do we have on this subject regarding computational models ?

self-consistent parametric form for equity implied volatility <eos> i recall reading a paper , but ca n't remember where i found it . in short , there was a parametric form for volatility smile/skew that fit both index and single stock vol slices and had intuitive parameters that were consistent in time . it was something like atm vol + skew + convexity + DIGIT or DIGIT parameters to take care of the otm quirks and the whole thing was based on log ( k/s ) /sqrt ( t ) axis so the parameters were more or less consistent in time . yet , at the same time it was not a stochastic volatility model , simply a parametric form for implied volatility . does anyone remember this paper or have heard of a parametric form that fits these requirements ?

how does a large cargo plane like the c-130 hercules take off and land in such a short distance ? <eos> so i was at an air show and saw a c-130j super hercules showcasing its capabilities . the take-off distance it covered was amazingly short ( i guess equal to fighter jets ) , even though it uses propeller based engines . the landing was also super short . my questions are : how does such a massive plane manage to take off in short distances ? is it because it has four engines ? during landing , i could n't see any thrust reverser ( as in commercial jets ) in play . what tech does it use to stop so quickly ?

how similar are circulating tumor cells and cancer stem cells ? <eos> circulating tumor cells ( ctcs ) are linked with metastasis and their presence can be used to indicate the onset of metastatic cancer . likewise , the cancer stem cell ( csc ) hypothesis suggests that tumorigenic stem cells are the source of cancer . however , microscopy experiments and cytometry have suggested that the morphology of ctcs and cscs are quite different . essentially , we have not been able to find circulating cancer stem cells ( asides myeloma since they are circulating anyways ) . my question is how similar are these cells ? if they are different , is relapse caused by the cscs from the primary tumor or ctcs in metasises that have become csc-like ?
wok and electric hob - which ring to use ? <eos> i 've a flat electric hob ( the gets-very-hot type , not induction ) upon which i cook . when using my wok ( which is flat-bottomed ) i place it on the largest ring , but obviously the pan only covers a relatively small potion of the ring . i had n't really thought about it , but for some reason yesterday i was cooking away and it dawned on me maybe the smaller rings would work better . do the larger rings normally produce more thermal energy , or the same amount just more spread out ? would it be better to use the ring that is about the same size as the base of the pan ?

what is morally wrong about altering someone 's behavior using psychological conditioning techniques ? <eos> i am reading the novel a clockwork orange . the priest is very angry at the behavior-altering technique being used on criminals to make them `` good '' and feels as though it is not right to take away free will , even from a murderer . he also argues that the person has n't actually changed , and that perhaps their soul is still guilty . is conditioning someone 's behavior to affect the choices they make tantamount to taking away someone 's free will ? it seems like the idea of doing this is morally wrong , but i ca n't put my finger on just why . what does philosophy have to say about this and other similar conditioning techniques , such as those suggested by psychologist b. f. skinner ?

purchasing fairtrade supermarket bananas or unknown bananas from a local business owner ? <eos> lately , i have been thinking about the above question . by buying fairtrade bananas , i ensure that the producers get paid above market price . however , i do support large-scale retail corporations which usually do n't see sustainability as their core business value . alternatively , i can buy bananas from an unknown source - and mostly not certified - at a local shop . the benefit here is that i support a local business owner , strengthen local relationships and support a shop that often prefers to give away food for free before having to throw food away that can not longer be sold . for me a difficult decision . what is your opinion ?

why does mars ' experience an 'ice age ' at high axis obliquity , when earth experiences an ice age at low axis obliquity <eos> this paper here goes into some detail about how mars ' experiences its own form of 'ice ages ' on a quasi periodic basis driven by the wobbling of its axis . the main mechanism outlined is that the stability of water ice on the surface increases with increased obliquity . this is in contrast to earth when at high obliquity there is increased polar summer insolation leading to metling . what is the difference ? on a more discussion based addition to the question , could factors such as ice albedo and other feedback loops play a similar role in mars ' ice ages that they do in earth 's ice ages ? i have also asked this at the astronomy stack exchange here

how do you create single sideband modulation ( ssb ) ? <eos> we 've heard this sound before ( think star wars ) , and i 've never tried to create it but have wondered about how it is done . then i heard it again today here and stumbled upon one person 's explanation : `` that 's not ring modulation . it 's single sideband suppressed carrier amplitude modulation , or ssb . essentially , take an am signal , cut it in half and remove the carrier . this means it takes up about half the spectrum and is still perfectly understandable , if not exactly broadcast quality . when receiving the signal , the radio reinserts the carrier and demodulates , resulting in that hollow sounding voice coming from the speakers .

how do you handle short-term asset allocation with hedge-funds ? <eos> assuming i want to run an optimization over a short period , say DIGIT years , i would decide to take daily values in order to compute the efficient frontier of a portfolio . that works fine as long as i have classical assets with daily indices . for other asset classes , these indices might not exists . how would you then proceed ? do you use monthly values ? if so , it looks like there wo n't be enough observations in the sample ( only DIGIT for DIGIT years ) ... would you then increase the period ? i guess one could try to do a linear interpolation of the points during the months , but it would be useless as the resulting series would have more `` generated '' points than original ones . is there another alternative ?

is the des `` mangler '' function invertible ? <eos> the des symmetric cipher is based on a feistel network operating repeated on 32-bit halves of the 64-bit block . the usage of feistel means that the `` mangler '' function used does not need to be invertible . the `` mangler '' function operates by expanding a 32-bit word to 48-bits via a simple algorithm . this DIGIT bits is the combined with a key and then converted back to 32-bits via s-boxes . the s-boxes obviously are not invertible , because they take a 6-bit input and produce a 4-bit output . but is the entire construction invertible . assuming the key is fixed , does each 32-bit input to the `` mangler '' function map to a distinct 32-bit output ? or are some 32-bit outputs never produced by the mangler function hence making it non-invertible ?

can you bust a tfr while operating under ifr ? <eos> is it possible for the pilot to be held responsible for violating a temporary flight restriction if the controller makes a mistake while you are operating under an instrument flight plan ( ie : does not deviate you around it , or allows you to go through it without clearing you with the responsible body ) ? it is a commonly held belief that the pilot is immune from tfrs while under ifr , but i found a forum thread that seems to indicate the opposite , where both the pilot and the controller were at fault and both received a suspension . URL ( bonus : can anyone find a more official reference for that story , and whether there was any legal followup from aopa legal or otherwise ? )

power of holm 's multiple comparison testing compared to others <eos> following one-way anova , there are many possible follow-up multiple comparison tests . holm 's test ( or better , the holm-sidak ) test has lots of power , but because it works in a stepwise manner , it can not compute confidence intervals . its advantage over the tests than can compute confidence intervals ( tukey , dunnett ) is that is has more power . but is it fair to say that the holm method always has more power than the methods of tukey and dunnet ? or does it depend ... ?

is vision a vestigial sense for deep ocean species ? <eos> sunlight does n't penetrate beyond a couple of hundred feet from the surface of the ocean . species that exist at greater depth probably live in a state of perpetual night ; yet from a quick google image search ( i agree it is n't a very authoritative source ) for deep ocean species i see that plenty of these have eyes . so ... are the sight organs in deep oceans species merely a remnant from an earlier era ? if they are a remnant , has evolution/mutation modified these organs over time ? regardless of whether the organs of sight are vestigial organs for deep ocean species , how do the eyeballs withstand the extreme pressure of water in the deeps ?

why did the inverse correlation of stocks and commodities stopped working in 2008 ? <eos> usually , the commodities asset class is considered being inversely correlated with other asset classes , due to its nature of an input for manufacturing ( if the prices of commodities go down , the manufacturers can produce for less , and have a larger profit , and vice versa ) . therefore , why during the stock market crash of 2008 , the commodities also went down , by far ? what happened macro-economically to stop this inverse correlation from working ?
will the amount of electricity used for mining be huge if bitcoin is widely adopted ? <eos> a quick and very rough estimation : if the usd/btc exchange rate grows to $ 1000/btc ( not that far-fetched if bitcoin is actually widely adopted ) bitcoins for a value of $ 300000 would be produced every hour , given the current rate of 50btc each DIGIT minutes . this should mean that the amount of money spent on mining is roughly the same , $ 300000/hour . given an electricy price of $ 0.01/kwh that means that 3gw , i.e . a rather large power plant , would be used solely for mining . is there anything fundamentally wrong about the above calculation ? is it a problem ?

( 7-1st significant digit , 6-2nd significant digit and 2=multiplying factor ( 100 ) ) but an electrolyte one is directly printed like : - 3400uf .
would you , as a programmer/developer , ever sign an nda ? <eos> venture capitalists never sign ndas vcs typically never sign ndas when asked because : they get approached with deals all day every day so they do n't need to sign ndas . they do n't want the exposure of being sued . they ca n't guarantee they wo n't be pitched the same idea by two different sources . question considering supply and demand , i.e. , the relatively high number of co-founders seeking a programmer/developer as their other co-founder ... would you , as a programmer/developer refuse to sign any ndas from prospective co-founders for the same reasons vcs do n't ?
is ai entirely a part of computer science ? <eos> both ai and computer science are sciences , as i understood from wikipedia , computer science is everything that has any relation to computers . and ai is commonly defined as study of machines that take the prerogative of humans ( creating musical pieces e.t.c but recently , when i was reading , i read this sentence : `` in computer science , ai is [ ... ] '' so my question is really : is there a part of ai studies that do not refer to computer science ?

why are humans risk-averse ? <eos> the economic theory and much of the decision theory are based on the assumption that we are risk-averse creatures ; in the sense that we are more sensitive to bad outcomes than the good ones and so decision-makers instead of maximizing an objective economic rewards , maximize the subjective values of those rewards ( utility functions ) which take into account this aversion . i have been studying economic theory and this risk-aversion concept comes a lot . i am wondering philosophically or psychologically , what are the real causes that makes us so . is this related to making rational choices ? what if we are not risk-averse by default , we just do n't know our preferences well and making decisions becomes so complex .
recording the upheaval in the middle east <eos> greetings all , political demonstrations and unrest on such a grand scale as what is occurring in egypt , iran and syria right now are rare - that 's what makes them so interesting to record and preserve . although they can be unnerving and violent , finding a way to safely record an event like this is important , so long as it can be done without putting yourself in harm 's way ( at least not too much ) . the lo-fi snippets i 've heard on the news have been amazing , imagine a high fidelity recording . do we have any ssders in those areas ?

is there symbolism in vronsky going bald in anna karenina ? <eos> as i am reading anna karinina i notice how as the story continues vronsky is going bald . as characters meet him it is noted how he tries to hid his increasing baldness . for instance when dolly goes to vronsky 's estate it is stated that he has taken to combing his hair in a way that hides his bald patch . characters before and after this also note his slowly increasing baldness and how he tries to hide this . am i right in thinking that his state of baldness may be a way of showing how the affair and love between anna and vronsky is slowly growing old and the way both are trying to hide this from themselves ?

what are the dynamics of a `` forced march ? '' <eos> in the `` art of war , '' sun tzu opined that if you put your army on a forced march of a certain speed , you will lose one-third of your troops along the way . a rough rule of thumb was that an army would start to disintegrate after losing about one third of its strength . at what point do armies tend to break ? were the advantages to be gained by a forced march usually enough to compensate for such a diminution of an army 's strength ? or did an army on a forced march lose significantly less than one-third its strength because it sloughed off ( by definition ) its weakest members ?

is there a study that seeks to quantify left/right bias by gender and country ? <eos> here in russia , women tend to be much more right-wing than men . women more often support free market , privatization , vote for billionaires , support the us and nato policy , support copyright , anti-communism and other policies associated with the right-wing . men are much more patriotic , support big government , protectionism , budget spending , price control , nationalization of key industries and pressure on the oligarchs . they also often express anti-americanism and oppose nato bombings worldwide . women are also more kin to learn foreign languages and get a profession associated with finances and management while men are likely to work in industry and to study engineering . so i want to learn what is average distribution of political sympathies between right-wing and left-wing policies by sexes in other countries .

'daemons ' vis-a-vis transcendental personification of self-will <eos> greek mythology , classical philosophy and early theology is teeming with things referred to as 'daemons ' . many , such as those of plato 's socrates , hint at an externalised transcendental corollary of will . in many senses the dualism that pervaded early western philosophy could be said to be descended from this conception , but the loss of the character of being an external cause merits a distinction . the modern explicit uses of the terms 'daemon ' and 'daemonic ' i have found tend to refer to external perversions of ordinary will , rather than all of will itself . so my question is : has anyone written ( and i envisage here likely a writer of psychoanalysis ) on the subject of daemons vis-a-vis transcendental personification of self-will in non-mythic terms ?

french school of 16th century <eos> i would like to know if you could help me define which school influenced this decision ? a couple of brazilians living in the united states had to appeal to the high court of justice of brazil to ensure the right to divorce in brazil because in the previous decisions it was denied because even though thye married in brazil , they live in usa ( the brazilian law influenced by story´s commentaries on the conflict of law says that the law of the domicile will be used in case of divorce ) . the high court of justice accepted the appeal allowing the couple to divorce through brazilian law since the marriage was celebrated in brazil . is it possible to say that the decision of the high court of justice was influenced by the french school of 16th century with the theory of d'argentré ?
use of co. in a non-registered business name <eos> a few of my friends and i have started a business in canada , and in our name we have `` co.

do we ever consider the size of the pixel to calculate the color in ray tracing ? <eos> from what i 'm reading , it looks like a ray tracer views a pixel as one color and computes that color using the ray starting in the center of that pixel . yet a pixel has a width and a height . do we ever use the actual square ( now a day pixels are considered squares ) that the pixel represents to calculate it true color from all possible source within that entire square ? i am thinking that this is how we come up with colors on edges of shapes in scanline rendering and was wondering whether the same could be applied to ray tracing . there is a picture which i hope better represents what i am trying to ask here . should we only consider the pixels to be single points ? or are we to consider pixels as large areas ?

intuition behind the positive slope of lm curve : 'income must increase ' ? <eos> source : by john floyd phd ( in economics ; u chicago ) the intuition behind the positive slope of lm is as follows : an increase in the interest rate reduces the demand for money and an increase in income increases it [ the demand for money ] . to [ ... ] [ equalize ] the demand for money equal to a constant money supply as the interest rate rises and we move along the lm curve , the level of income must increase . would someone please explain the bolded ? it sounds too imperious and presumptuous : how must a rise in interest rate increase consumers ' level of income ? eg , employers can still refuse to increase salary . then income would not increase ?

how are rockets tested ( hot fire ) ? <eos> given that the majority of the operation of a chemical rocket is at different altitudes / pressures than at ground level , how are hot fire ground tests conducted to gather useful information about efficiency , thrust , etc ? i imagine there is some process of 'truing ' the thrust , as well - making sure the vector points in a particular direction , like a bike wheel . how is this confirmed ? additionally ... how do you gather information from a stream of hot exhaust that is several thousand degrees ? maybe my assumptions are way off-base . just curious what some of the actual engineering processes are .

is this assertion by sartre an existentialist reading pascal 's pensées ? <eos> in his book what is literature ? , sartre says : here , i am thinking of pascal , who relentlessly repeated that man was an irrational composite of metaphysics and history , his greatness unexplainable if he comes from the alluvium , his misery unexplainable if he is still as god made him ; that in order to understand man , one had to go back to the simple basic fact of man 's downfall . should one consider this as an existentialist reading of pascal 's pensées ?
why does a car engine not do work if the wheels do n't slip ? <eos> i saw this mind boggling result that if the tires do n't slip then the work done by an engine to move a car is zero . why is this true ? moreover , what does this truly mean ? update : sorry about not being clear , but i was talking about an idealised case where air resistance is negligible and the tires are perfectly rigid and there is no internal friction at play .

why do animal teeth get darker if exposed ? <eos> i was wondering why the teeth of cats ( and dogs , as far as i know , plus possibly some other animals or even humans ) get darker if they are exposed to air / light ? example : ( see the lower end of the tooth , which sticks out if the mouth is closed . no , the cat was not resisting , just slightly annoyed . ) so , my question is : why does this happen ? would it happen to human teeth , if they would stick out of the mouth like the ones of cats do ? my guess is that it has something to do with the teeth reacting to air and corroding , but all my knowledge about biology comes from two years of biology in school , so i 'm asking here .

radiance at a nearly perpendicular angle is almost infinite ? <eos> as far as i understand , radiance is a measure of the `` intensity '' of light in a direction defined as a differential cone . it 's measure is flux per solid angle per projected area . $ l = frac { dphi } { domega da^perp } = frac { dphi } { domega dacos ( theta ) } $ . using this definition , it seems like as the $ theta $ angle increases , radiance increases , thus light is somehow more `` intense '' in a direction nearly perpendicular to the normal at point p. this contradicts my intuition . where am i interpreting this wrong ?

teaching neural net via video footage <eos> is it possible to train a neural network to learn something via video footage ? in other words , if i have a video teaching me how to draw an animal from scratch , can i then use this video to teach the computer to draw the animal in the same way ? edit : video footage is essentially a sequence of images , any image processing capabilities available to us through machine learning are possible when applied to videos using a sequencial network ( lstm , rnn etc . ) so i guess the difficult part becomes mapping the activity to an action like moving a pen or something
can a team sell tickets to a practice ? <eos> the tigers have about a week off between now and the world series . is there anything in the rules about not letting a team sell tickets for practice ? my thought is that by having a stadium full of fans would feel more like a real game and keep the players in the mindset they have during the season . they would n't necessary have to sell tickets but just a way to basically have an open inter team game ? edit ( from comment below ) : i was thinking more of the inter squad games they were playing . they would still have their closed off from public so they could concentrate on how to play the other team . the inter squd game with a crowd would give the feeling that it is just a regular season game and keep them in that mind set

sea level in paleogeographic maps <eos> most paleogeographic maps available ( c. r. scotese or r. blakey maps for instance ) show not only the shape of the continents during the concerned period but also the level of the seas and oceans ( i. e. the coastlines , the epicontinental seas , etc. ) . since haq et al . 1987 , there has been quite a few reconstructions of the global relative sea level changes for parts of the phanerozoic . but going from such global curves to actual maps showing the approximative coastlines and epicontinental seas does require a fair amount of extra information such as paleobathymetry of the oceans and paleoaltimetry of the continents to name the more obvious . so my question is : do we have such informations on a global scale ? or are the sea level representation on such maps just a shot in the dark ?

why are cats afraid of vacuums ? <eos> my cats are pretty stereotypically afraid of my vacuum . as soon as they see me getting ready to use it , they 'll jump up . the second it gets turned on , they 're bolting to the other room . i watch movies and play video games that make sudden loud noises , so it does n't seem likely to me that the vacuum is scary because it 's loud . is there something else about the noise that 's scary ? i was thinking maybe the frequency was at a certain level that only bothers cats , like how humans ca n't hear dog whistles . what is it about vacuums that are so scary ?
features in individuals causing high population variation <eos> as i understand it , a population with high variation is something sought after , since it makes the population better equipped to face a dynamic environment . then , i guess features in an individual which causes it 's population 's variation to be high , should be selected for ( high mutation rate , other features.. ? ) . if so , does this manifest itself partly as individuals preferring to mate with individuals from another population ? ( with genetic difference within reason , perhaps a norm for a proffered genetic difference between individuals )
why is a shy or reserved person often perceived as cold or arrogant ; also , how can such an impression be mitigated ? <eos> it is my personal experience in india that someone who is shy or reserved is often perceived as arrogant/ cold/ selfish , though that may be a very inaccurate assessment . it has happened to me because i am somewhat reserved by nature , but unfortunately i have instinctively developed this same misconception at least twice myself when somebody was reserved with me . later i realised that i had no reason at all to interpret their reserve as arrogance . my friends who live abroad say that this is a common perception in many cultures . what is the basis of perceiving a shy or reserved person as cold or arrogant ? also , how can such an impression be mitigated without putting on an act or actually changing one 's personality , which is not at all natural and also very difficult ?

from a high frequency point of view , with a price prediction and assuming infinite leverage , how do you determine optimal trade size ? <eos> i have read about something like kelly criterion for long term expectation maximization assuming a fixed starting bankroll . but if one can assume unlimited leverage , and one has a signal for a price movement..how could one go about deciding optimal trading sizes ? it would seem to me like there are a lot of factors involved ( things like transaction costs , inventories , etc.. ) - in practice would one come up with some intuitive model for this and run historical simulations for it ? or how would one tackle this ? is there any literature which i can read up on to understand this problem better ?

does economics as a science or a technology take only the legitimate economy as its proper field of study ? <eos> my impression as a science or a technology it takes only the legitimate economy ( that is under the rule of law ) as its proper sphere . that there is a preponderance of studies on the legitimate economy may be simply due to its greater visibility , its obvious legitimacy , the enormous mass of data associated with it . but it seems to me that the illegitimate economy has an equal right to be called an economy . it has its own law immanent in itself . are there any studies that say how these two economic substances actually interact ? where one substance flows into the other ( by seeking a weak point to puncture by violence or cunning ) ? then is there then only one actual economic substance ?
why is there no economics theory largely accepted or considered true ? <eos> an exact science is any field of science capable of accurate quantitative expression or precise predictions and rigorous methods of testing hypotheses , especially reproducible experiments involving quantifiable predictions and measurements . physics and chemistry can be considered as exact sciences in this sense . physicists always agree each other on their theories and their predictions . economics is a science that analyzes the production , distribution , and consumption of goods and services and economists , just as physicist , use mathematical modeling to achieve their results . that being said , i 'm unable to understand why economists always disagree each other on their theories and why still today there is no economics theory that is largely accepted or considered true , in contrast with newtonian mechanics or quantum mechanics that are considered no longer debatable . can anybody explain ?

is distributed computing more or less sustainable than centralised computing ? <eos> my case example is blockchain , the main technology behind bitcoin , which is more and more being studied for other uses . as far as i understand , it 's great for decentralising a registry/ledger of transactions , that can be financial or otherwise ( you could have a decentralized github , for example ) . but it seems to me that the current amount of calculation required for bitcoin mining and transaction log is very , very high . more generally , centralised computing is more optimized and efficient than decentralised coputing ? i know some figures for some data-centers . if we are heading to a future of distribute computing even for industries before centralised as banking , i 'd like to understand is this averagely more efficient , energy-wise , or if we are cutting physical transportation .

the myth of exploitation according to the labor theory of value <eos> according to the labor theory of value , a good is worth as much as the labor put into it . we might then go further and assume that the labor put into it was as valuable as the goods used to fuel that labor ( and so on and so on ) . how then can a theory of exploitation be maintained ? since laborers by definition receive the worth of their labor as subsistence wages ?

terminating an employment agreement with non existing `` statutory notice period '' <eos> i received an employment contract for a definite term of six months . one of the articles in this agreement states ( literally ) : the agreement can be terminated prematurely by each of the parties with due observance of the statutory notice period . according to the dutch law , there is only a statutory notice period defined for indefinite term contracts . to terminate a definite term contract , the law requires mutual written agreement of both parties ( besides cantonal court , urgent dismissal or after consent of the employee insurance agency ) . the contract itself does not determine any notice period , neither does the law , so what ( if anything ) does this article effectively mean ? would it automatically fall back to the law applicable to indefinite term contracts ?
plastic wrapper stretch <eos> i 'm studying how industrial plastic film pallet wrappers work . the wrappers apply a certain amount of pre-stretch to the plastic film ( by means of different rolls ) before applying it to the object that has to be wrapped . if the object to be wrapped is n't spherical , i.e . it has edges , then the plastic film is pulled more when it reaches an edge , and so there is an variation in how much the plastic stretches . i believe that this variation in stretching leads to the plastic film breaking when the pallet is rotating very quickly and subsequently has high pull on the film . are there techniques that make it possible to even out these variations and to make the tension the film is under during application more uniform ?

why do we have to partition non-convex polygons into convex polygons in a map in binary space partitioning ? <eos> this article says that binary space partitioning divides the map into convex polygons . [ ... ] before the map can be rendered we must perform a number of calculations on it . however , once these calculations are performed their results can be used many times . this is one of the advantages of bsp — once the calculations are performed they do not need to be done again , unless the map is changed . bsp only allows ” static ” maps , or ones that do not move . if a map has any moving parts then they must be rendered separately . what must be done is to partition , or divide up , the map into convex polygons . why should non-convex polygons be partitioned into convex polygons ? is there a mathematical basis behind this ?

determining the ph of an organic solvent <eos> our work is faced with the issue of determining the charge of compounds that are dissolved in chloroform . one could realistically determine the charge of the relevant moieties knowing the $ mathrm { pk_a } $ of those groups . however , how would you determine or calculate the ph of an organic solvent ? an alternative way of asking this question is how would one calculate the concentration of hydronium ions or free protons in a nonaqueous solution .
seeking title and/or author of dystopian science-fiction novel from late-70s/early-80s <eos> in the novel , humans all lived underground and were decanted - not born , were undersized , short-lived , emotionally-empty , and prone to suicide and freak-outs . above ground there were mechanized factory farms of mono-cultures with no native life remaining ; a single robotic whale swam the oceans . in the denouement , a number of long voyage space ships returned to reseed the planet with a genetic library sent from far in the past . i read it in the mid-1980s on the the heels of reading `` ecotopia '' which seems to have eclipsed any memory of the title for this book . any ideas ?

what is the degrowth perspective on ad blocking and online advertising ? <eos> from a degrowth perspective , how would one argue in favour or against ad blocking and online advertising ? to give a perspective on degrowth , degrowth is a political , economic , and social movement based on ecological economics , anti-consumerist and anti-capitalist ideas that tries to address the limits to growth dilemma ( constraints of a finite planet ) . surely , online advertising fuels consumption . yet it is also a potential source of income for anti-consumerist alternatives and blocking advertising thus closes this opportunity of income generation .

should i care if my short story has the same title as someone else 's book ? <eos> it appears to be a pretty obscure book . it 's on amazon , but there are no descriptions or reviews . from the cover , i 'd say it was a kids book , which would put it in a different market . let 's assume that this short story of mine is fit to publish , for arguments ' sake , because otherwise i certainly do n't mind the duplication . i suppose what this boils down to is : will the publisher care ?
is it ethically correct to be proud of one 's country ? <eos> it is a very well known phenomena that people feel pride for the country where they were born and/or live , even though the effect seems to be declining slightly nowadays . frequently , governments also try to instill a sense of national pride in their citizens in order to motivate them to serve the country . but is it ethically correct to be proud of one 's country ? when people say that they are proud of being a citizen of a country that has an independent jurisdiction , is a democracy and respects its citizens ' rights , the obvious question to me is : can you be proud of something that you did not create ?

existence of a perfect measurable set <eos> given a set $ e $ which is bounded , measurable and $ m^ { ast } ( e ) =x > 0 $ , then for each $ y in ( 0 , x ) $ we can find a measurable set $ a subset e $ , such that $ m^ { ast } ( a ) =y $ . to see this one considers measure as a continuous function and applies the intermediate value property . now we extend the question in the following manner : suppose $ e $ is a set which has finite measure , then for each positive $ x & lt ; m^ { ast } ( e ) $ prove that there exists a perfect set $ a subset e $ , such that $ m^ { ast } ( a ) =x $ .

why do some paperbacks have shortened front covers ? <eos> some paperback editions have a front cover which is a centimetre or two shorter than the actual book . i first noticed this on house of leaves , where i thought that it 's just part of the whole experimental deal ( representing the house whose inside is larger than the outside , and/or just putting the book firmly into uncanny valley ) , but since then i 've seen a couple of other books which do this , like this paperback edition of ken liu 's the paper menagerie : so i 'm assuming this is actually a thing that is done for some books , and googling confirms that . however , i have n't found any good sources on why this is done .

centre pawn vs. side pawn ? <eos> chess theory suggests that pawns whose file is nearer to the central files are more powerful . this is somewhat obvious for the rook 's pawn , which can attack only one square as opposed to the other pawns , which can each attack two squares . however , in practice , even the rook 's pawn turns out to be somewhat useful as a pawn at a3 or h3 can deter the opponent bishop coming to b4 or g4 . in practice , are the pawns on central files really more powerful than the pawns on the side files ? what is the reason ? does the situation change during the end game as opposed to the openings ?
is the tolerance of pitch of a thread standarized ? <eos> as i was browsing iso DIGIT it defines tolerances on a plenty of variables regarding metric threads , but it gives the pitch of the thread as a simple number from an allowed set ( DIGIT – DIGIT – 1,5 – 1– 0,75 – 0,5 – 0,35 – 0,25 – 0,2 ) , and no tolerances on these are ever given . why is it so ? are they defined in some other standard or is there a specific reason why they are n't defined to a given tolerance ? specifically , when i 'm using a threaded rod as a lead-screw actuator , i 'd like to know what inaccuracy can i expect coming from imprecision of pitch - how accurately do DIGIT turns of a m10x1 threaded rod convert to 1000mm travel distance of the nut ( minus backslash etc ) ?

republican thought in the middle ages <eos> i wonder if there were any books written in the middle ages that argued the case for a republic versus a monarchy . on the opposite side we can find dante 's de monarchia ( and probably many others ) who argued for monarchy . marsilius of padua might be an example of what i am looking for - or might not . after all his work was heavily used in imperialist and royalist ideology , so he must have been a queer sort of republican , if at all . ( i have n't yet read his works myself , so i hope i 'm not distorting too much ) . also , he seems to have been more concerned with the opposition between secular and ecclesiastical power rather than with various forms of secular government . let 's say for time limits , anything preceding machiavelli .

differences between ackermann steering and standard bi/tricycles concerning kinematics ? <eos> i got the following homework question : what are the general differences between robots with ackermann steering and standard bicycles or tricycles concerning the kinematics ? but , i do n't see what differences there should be , because a car-like robot ( with DIGIT fixed rear wheels and DIGIT dependent adjustable front wheels ) can be seen as a tricycle-like robot ( with a single adjustable front wheel in the middle ) . then , if you let the distance between the two rear wheels approach zero , you get the bicycle . so , i ca n't see any difference between those three mobile robots . is there something i am missing ?

how long has the `` scene '' method been used for writing a novel ? <eos> i 've noticed that many authors discuss `` building '' their novels using scenes as the fundamental building block . be it by software or notecard , the scenes are identified , arranged and written , then chapter divisions made . from what i have read , it appears to be the accepted method of novel writing these days . does anyone know when ( and where ) it first started to be used ? the reason i ask is that 25+ years ago i received my undergraduate degree in creative writing and although i had a number of courses in fiction writing , i ca n't recall ever even hearing about scenes in writing . nor were they mentioned in my literature courses . is it something relatively new or were my undergraduate studies subpar ?

does cooking food prevent the body from efficiently absorbing minerals ? <eos> it is true that we absorb minerals from cooked food less efficiently , because the membranes of our cells are made up mostly of hydrogen ions , therefore cooking food lose its anionic charge and it become more cationic ? so in other words , it makes the food less healthy ? this can be demonstrated by kirlian photography of cooked food which capture the phenomenon of electrical coronal discharges : image found at : the tao of dana which gives the impression of reduction of anionic charge . therefore if alkalinity is altered due to cooking , it could influence the structural , functional and enzymatic aspects of the food making the nutritions less absorbable .
best way to remesh a quad 3d mesh ? <eos> i have a quad-based 3d mesh . i want to : remesh it while keeping the shape the same the end output should be in quads ideally it should have a similar number of verts / polys as the input ideally the remeshing would be random , and output mesh would be distinct from the input right now i 'm remeshing with meshlab , which outputs tris . i then use the tris to quads function from blender . the problem is that that function is not perfect , and leaves many tris . so ideally there 'd be a quad-based random remesh tool , but if anyone knows of a better tri-to-quad tool that would also be helpful ? thank you .

given wittgenstein 's characterisation of language as essentially public , can he characterise what form thinking takes ? <eos> according to wittgenstein , language is an essentially public activity between minds ; and language is structured by a grammar so that this communication can indeed occur . i think , the notion of language is equivalent to grammar ( a structuring ) ; as grammar stipulates the range and form of the expression of the language . but minds also think , and this is a private activity ; so it can not be of the form of any kind of language , and so can not have any kind of grammar , hence any kind of structuring . does he make the claim that thinking can not be rationally explicated to any extent , ie given some kind of structure ? ( i 'm tempted to conflate thinking with conciousness , but i think that would be a mistake . )
is it possible to get access to flight logs of usaac trainer planes from the 1930s ? <eos> after answering this question on history.se , i started to wonder if it would be possible to find out even more detail about the plane now that its serial number is known . i have no idea what kind of flight records the us army air corps kept , however . i know most flight logs today are kept by pilot , but i imagine there would be some way to trace what pilots flew a particular plane . i have no idea if this is possible for usaac trainer planes in the 1930s . could i get access to these records ? if so , how would i go about it ? i 'm mostly interested in seeing if i can find out more information about where the plane flew , and maybe ( if i 'm lucky ) who flew it when and for what purpose .

why did the ussr give crimea to ukraine ? <eos> in DIGIT soviets transferred crimea from russian soviet republic to ukrainian soviet republic . why is this strange ? the whole act , at least officially , was meant to be `` a gift '' , a token of friendship . you do not normally give huge pieces of land in moderate climate , which are also strategically located . russians are not known for giving land away , quite the contrary - russia has been constantly expanding since xvii century . after the deportation of the tatars by stalin russians were the majority population of crimea at that time ( and still are ) . russia does n't seem to have a solid foothold of the black sea coast - it seems that their only usable naval port apart from sevastopol ( which is in crimea and is only leased from ukraine ! ) is novorossiysk .

what part of the graphics chain rotates computer displays when in portrait mode ? <eos> when the display hardware is physically rotated DIGIT degrees , your graphics can still be rendered with the correct side up . where is this rotation accomplished ? i can imagine a few possibilities : a ) the code for every low-level graphics primitive contains something to converts its arguments , like if ( portrait ) { swap ( x , y ) ; } ( or perhaps multiplying every coordinate with a matrix ) b ) the part of the graphics card that continuously scans its memory to create a video signal reads the data in a different order . c ) the monitor paints the received data column by column instead of row by row a and b sounds like they would be inefficient and c means that it would only work on monitors that has special hardware-support for rotation . which one is it ?

what is the correct order of transformations scale , rotate and translate and why ? <eos> this is a rather primitive question coming from an electronic engineer . when applying rotate ( about origin ) , scale ( in which we shall translate towards origin and then back ) and translate , does it matter in what order we do it ? why ? basically in my case i have an image in coordinate space that goes from DIGIT to +2 in x and DIGIT to +1.5 in y to get ration of 4:3. this range comes from how the original mandelbrot set is plotted . i need to scale and translate this to fit into an axes ( of pixels ) in bitmap that goes from DIGIT to DIGIT in x axis and DIGIT to DIGIT in y axis . i am trying to understand what matrix to use to scale and translate the points from my mandelbrot set into the bitmap image .

locked in to salary when accepting a long contract extension ? <eos> i 've been offered a long contract extension after having worked relatively short period . the salary would be the same as before and i 'm thinking that if i sign it , i wo n't be able to negotiate the salary anymore during this long period . the contract will be between me and the contracting company , which then works with a second contracting company , but the second contracting company said they 'll want to move me to other projects in a few months . now i 'm thinking they 'll move me on other projects but the salary will remain the same while the workload , etc . will be different . i 'm quite new to freelancing , so i do n't know how to correctly handle this situation . thank you !
how isotropic is the earth 's inner core boundary ? <eos> often , in texts ( particularly for schools etc ) depict a smooth spherical isotropic boundary between the inner and outer core , as shown in the image from this usgs public education page : the inner core boundary is between the inner and outer core layers . how isotropic is the earth 's inner core boundary ? related questions how can we guess the size of the earth 's inner core ( and what it 's made of ) ? why does seismic activity shed light on the inner core rigidity ? why is earth 's inner core solid ? these are related but this question is about the nature of the boundary between the inner and outer core .
what are the ten courses of action ( kamma ) ? <eos> in the visuddhimagga , on the topic of virtue , there is a reference to the ten courses of action ( kamma ) : furthermore , virtue as volition is the seven volitions [ that accompany the first seven ] of the [ ten ] courses of action ( kamma ) in one who abandons the killing of living things , and so on . virtue as consciousness-concomitant is the [ three remaining ] states consisting of non-covetousness , non-ill will , and right view , stated in the way beginning , “ abandoning covetousness , he dwells with a mind free from covetousness ” ( d i 71 ) . i know the quote is taken out of context from the chapter , but i was just wondering about the ten courses of action ( kamma ) , and their reference and significance ?
should i apply to the same vacancy i was n't accepted to if it comes up again in the future ? <eos> i went for an interview last december , did n't get the job but i requested feedback and they said i was very close and it just so happened that on that day there was someone else there with more experience specifically in that field . they said to me to apply again should they have more vacancies . now , it 's DIGIT months later , the same vacancy came up again and i am not even invited for an interview this time . what is going on ? very disappointed to say so at least . there is no point in even asking why , or is there ? so is it ever a good idea to apply again with an organisation you have already applied for and did n't get the job ?
liquid with low specific heat and high thermal conductivity ( relative to water ) ? <eos> as the title suggests – does there exist a liquid with a lower specific heat then water but with a higher thermal conductivity ? i thought of this in the context of sous vide cooking : ideally , the liquid involved would transfer heat to the food quickly ( hence high thermal conductivity ) , but would also respond to quick changes in temperature ( hence the low specific heat ) , reducing the risk / time of heater element overshoot . so , are there such liquids ? ( preferable ones that stay liquid between DIGIT and DIGIT degrees celsius ) .

which is a better way of obtaining scales , gaussian blur or down sampling ? <eos> in computer vision , scales are important when we carry out a scene analysis . choosing different scales affect the result of the analysis . for example , if a face is relatively small in the scene , then the details including nose , eyes will be omitted . on the other hand , details on larger faces become relatively more salient . i know both gaussian blur with different sigmas and down sampling on the image can generate different scales . which is more reasonable on a cognitive sense ?

proving $ \sum\limits_ { k=0 } ^ { n-1 } \bigl [ x + \frac { k } { n } \bigr ] = [ nx ] $ <eos> right , this is an exercise in apostol , which i am not being able to solve . i was able to prove this result for a small case , that is the case when $ n=2 $ , $ [ x ] + bigl [ x + frac { 1 } { 2 } bigr ] = [ 2x ] $ , but i am struggling with the generalization . prove that $ $ sumlimits_ { k=0 } ^ { n-1 } biggl [ x + frac { k } { n } biggr ] = [ nx ] , $ $ where $ [ ] $ denotes the greatest integer function . can this be proved via induction , i ask this because i have shown it to be already true for $ n=2 $ .

are 'winter ' varieties important when sowing beans & peas in late autumn/fall ? <eos> this list of jobs for november suggests sowing peas and broad beans . the comments section is more specific about varieties to go for , namely : aquadulce for broadbeans and douce provence for peas . how important is it to use the suggested varieties ? would using any old beans/peas result in nothing at all , or just produce slightly inferior results ( or something in between ) ? should i expect germination and a small plant over winter , or do the seeds just sit there in the ground only for something to appear in feb/mar ? the comments also suggest they go straight into the ground , but presumably starting off in pots will also work ?
all lav production sound <eos> i just started working on the dialog for this short film that only used lavs . first off there are times where cloth movement got recorded during the take . the director does n't want to do adr on the cu shots , because he wants performance over clarity and that 's when a lot of the cloth movement occurred . is there anything i can do to get rid of the cloth movement ? here 's one of the dialog tracks : bar DIGIT by mitchell scott also , is it possible to make the recorded lav takes sound anywhere near the depth and fullness of a shotgun mic ? thanks !

is cause and effect part of an individual 's theory of the mind ? <eos> one of the arguments marshaled against traditional cultures ' invocation of spirits is that they 're simply projecting their own fears onto the world . that they 're anthropomorphizing the world . it is notable that individuals have a telos . it would be bizarre for us to come across someone who did things arbitrarily . even say the incorporation of chance elements in an artwork is motivated by telos . are we anthropomorphizing the world when we incorporate cause and effect into our understanding of how the world acts ?

negotiations on returns <eos> i purchased a dress shirt from store that i shop from often . i washed the shirt and the button came off . i have several dress shirts and have washed them dozens of time , without problems . i went to return the shirt since its quality was in question . the store manager kept attempting to negotiate on return policy stating `` saleable condition '' -i.e . worn , washed , missing button . i attempted to negotiate on quality -i.e . shoddy merchandise , expected quality of sold items , with the response `` take it up with the manufacturer .

why does the emperor-over-the-sea play such a small role in the chronicles of narnia ? <eos> the emperor-over-the-sea is referenced at several points during the series . the stone table , deep magic and the deeper magic were all set in motion by him , and he is the father of aslan . at the same time , he does not directly enter the series ; he does not appear to be present in aslan 's country during the silver chair or the events of the voyage of the dawn treader , and does n't appear to directly intervene . he does n't even seem to be present at the creation of narnia during the magician 's nephew or the final judgment in the last battle - the entire country was sang into existence by aslan . given that c. s. lewis was not a deist , why is this ? why was the emperor-over-the-sea such a remote figure ?

is stomach acid an emulsion ? <eos> it occurred to me that oils float on water , and the stomach is always full of aqueous solution . the stomach empties at the bottom , meaning that oils would only ever pass out of the stomach when it is clear of water , which it never is . assuming stomach acid is not an emulsion , oils would slowly build up above the water , which would negatively affect health if they never drain . assuming it is an emulsion , the oils can drain with the aqueous components , and that is that . so does the stomach have some special way of draining oils , or is stomach acid actually an emulsion . in either case , how ?

why are the total functions not enumerable ? <eos> we learned about the concept of enumerations of functions . in practice , they correspond to programming languages . in a passing remark , the professor mentioned that the class of all total functions ( i.e . the functions that always terminate for every input ) is not enumerable . that would mean that we can not devise a programming language that allows us to write all total functions but no others -- -which would be nice to have ! so how is it that we ( apparently ) have to accept the potential for non-termination if we want decent computational power ?
stm32f3 timers & computing <eos> i have an stm32f3 discovery board . i want to go to the next step and i want to try to use timers in a few configurations . how can i calculate variables ( such as prescaler , period ) ? i looked in all datasheets , manuals and did n't find anything that can describe these values as - input capture mode , op , pwm , etc . i think that prescaler is for downgrading a frequency from DIGIT so if i have fcpu=72mhz and want to generate a signal of frequency=40khz , am i supposed to do : 72mhz/40khz=1800 ? now should i subtract this prescaler with -1 ?

if buddha stayed unanswered on this matter , why do his followers preach that soul does n't exist ? <eos> almost every buddhist i 've met sincerely believes in non-existence of self or soul . especially , the vipassana practitioners say that scanning the body and finding no atman or self in it is proof that self does n't exist . but what about the practitioner himself who is scanning or performing the vipassana ? does n't that imply that he himself is the soul ? also , i found today that buddha himself stayed unanswered on this matter : the buddha states that it is unwise to be attached to both views of having and perceiving a self and views about not having a self . so , how can you argue that soul does n't exist when buddha himself did n't deny it ( or accept it either ) ? are there any branches of buddhism that believes in existence of soul ?

can rule induction be considered a way to `` hybridize '' probabilistic / statistical approaches and symbolic approaches ? <eos> in years past , gofai ( good old fashioned ai ) was heavily based on `` rules '' and symbolic computation based on rules . unfortunately , that approach ran into stumbling blocks , and the world moved heavily towards statistical/probabilistic approaches leading to the current wave of interest in `` machine learning '' . it seems though , that the symbolic/rule-based approach probably still has application . so , could one `` learn '' rules using a probabilistic rule induction method , and then layer symbolic computation on top ? if so , how could the whole process be made truly two-way , so that something `` learned '' from processing rules , can be fed back into how the system learns rules ?

converting from DIGIT degree vr to rectangular <eos> what i am interested in doing is taking a DIGIT degree stereo video ( oculus rift etc ) , and a description of how the viewing direction changes with time ( rather than reading from gyroscopes ) and then rendering that to a simple side by side rectangular video ( so that you can stick the result on a smartphone and view it with the inbuilt video viewer ) . this will naturally involve something like sphere mapping the source , and rendering the result , as the smartphone apps do . i am interested in doing this transformation offline . is there software around that already does this ? or what are the most suitable libraries to use if i want to program it myself ?
determining goalie stick length <eos> as an ice hockey goalie , i find it a bit hard to determine the correct length for my stick while at the store . i often find myself trying a few different lengths and even after buying it i 'm questioning my decision . while i generally have never picked one that is absurdly longer or shorter that affects me during a game , i ca n't help but feel like i may at times have chosen incorrectly and could be putting myself at a slight disadvantage that could be affecting my posture and position . is there a way to determine what is a correct length or perhaps a `` checklist '' i should go through while at the store to make sure i 've chosen a proper length for my stick ?
worn saddles on floyd-rose bridge break my strings <eos> i have two cort guitars with the same type of floyd rose bridge . one is about DIGIT years older than another . each of them has the same problem . the saddles are worn due to friction with the strings . it makes them serrated like a saw . then it breaks the string frequently and throws the remaining strings out of tune . i go to a luthier and he strips smooth again , but it never lasts long and the problem returns . i use tape between the string and the saddle to improve the durability . my question is , there 's a way to fix it without throwing them away and buying some new ones ?

what role does a protein 's size have on protein-protein interactions ? <eos> protein-protein interactions are when two or more proteins bind together , possibly for some important biological function . recently , i 'm starting to look more into proteins , and in particular , networks related to proteins , such as protein-protein interaction networks . i found myself thinking about the following question : question : does the relative size of two proteins significantly affect how likely they are to interact ? does it affect how they interact ? it would be plausible for me to download a protein-protein interaction network , and calculate their relative size from the proteins ' pdb files . however , i predict that the results from such a computation would not offer much insight into why ( or why not ) the protein sizes affect binding .

what is the effect of rising sea level on measurements of elevation ? <eos> if the earth 's mean sea level rises , i assume that requires humans to adjust current measurements of elevation ? for example , mt everest would no longer be 8,848 metres above sea level . is there a more stable universal way to measure elevation such as on other celestial objects ? i know that zero altitude on mars is defined as a specific atmospheric pressure of DIGIT pascals , about six millibars which is the triple point of water on mars , where it can exist as gas , liquid or solid . the zero elevation point of the moon is the average diameter since it has no atmosphere . so perhaps this is the most universal method to measure elevation ?

when simulating spectral line broadening , which convolution is preferred ? <eos> many computational chemistry packages permit the calculation of vibrational and electronic spectra . these spectra are obtained as a set of discrete eigenvalues however they are often convolved with some distribution to give a continuous spectrum that is realistic for a finite temperature , rather than a sequence of impulse functions . the adf package allows the user to convolve the spectrum with either a gaussian or cauchy ( lorentzian ) function . my understanding is that the latter affords a more realistic line broadening , however the gaussian must be there for a reason . which spectral broadening scheme is preferred ? why the choice ?

algorithmic intuition for logarithmic complexity <eos> i believe i have a reasonable grasp of complexities like $ mathcal { o } ( 1 ) $ , $ theta ( n ) $ and $ theta ( n^2 ) $ . in terms of a list , $ mathcal { o } ( 1 ) $ is a constant lookup , so it 's just getting the head of the list . $ theta ( n ) $ is where i 'd walk the entire list , and $ theta ( n^2 ) $ is walking the list once for each element in the list . is there a similar intuitive way to grasp $ theta ( log n ) $ other than just knowing it lies somewhere between $ mathcal { o } ( 1 ) $ and $ theta ( n ) $ ?

does the duckworth–lewis method work correctly for all matches ? <eos> d/l method is commonly used for limited over matches . does it work fine ? the opening players did n't know it would rain that day , so they defend to stand for DIGIT to DIGIT overs ; then how is it correct for deciding the victory by this ? some teams may have aggressive players in the bottom order , so we ca n't judge by losing DIGIT or DIGIT wickets . some other teams mostly depend on one or more star players ; if the bowling side tried hard to pick them at the last stage , then the d/l method will give the victory to the batting side . is this method the only choice for the cricket officials ?

wax paper as a fire starter <eos> one thought led to another and i started wondering how effective wax paper would be to bring along as tinder to start a fire . i 've seen suggestions of using paraffin in conjunction with other materials as a firestarter , so it seems like paraffin-coated paper could be really useful , as well as really easy and cheap to acquire and bring with you anywhere ( plus it 's somewhat waterproof ) . however , i 've never really seen any mention of it before . i 'll probably try some experiments with it later , but was wondering if there were other thoughts on the matter . it might not even be possible ; after all , it seems like some wax papers might be meant to go in the oven without burning ( and i 'm not talking about parchment paper ) .
comforting a gender-fluid partner experiencing dysphoria <eos> my partner is gender-fluid and occasionally experiences dysphoria . most often it seems to be caused by societal pressure to conform to their assigned gender , but occasionally they seem to have some body dysphoria as well . i 'm familiar with dysphoria primarily in binary trans contexts and agender contexts , but i 'm a little unsure of how to be comforting and supportive to a gender-fluid person , as their presentation changes . i really want to be supportive and my partner often turns to me for comfort when they 're feeling dysphoric . i usually try to listen and offer kind words of encouragement , but it often feels lacking . as a supportive partner , how do i offer comfort to a gender-fluid partner experiencing dysphoria ? clarifications : their pronouns are they/them/their . they also have the support of a licensed therapist .

less maintenance-dependent continuous ph testing <eos> i am creating an automated chemical component mixing system ( diy project ) . one of the features required is continuous monitoring of ph value in my main solution . i do not need it to be very precise , precision of DIGIT would be enough . also , i want it to be as low maintenance as possible ( cleaning the probe once a month would be great ) . ph of the solution will vary from $ ph = 4 $ to $ ph = 7 $ . so , the question is , which of this testing ways will require less maintenance of ph probe : constant submersion in the solution . once per hour dipping in the solution .
how do you decide when to pivot and when to bail for a new destination ? <eos> a wise traveler once said , `` you ca n't reach your destination , if you do n't know where you 're going .

on-site repulsion and pauli exclusion <eos> been studying hopping conduction and something that everyone is taking for granted is bothering me . let 's say we have a bunch of sites that are either unoccupied , singly occupied , or doubly occupied . due to on-site coulomb repulsion the two electron levels are separated by u energy at a doubly occupied site . now everyone is saying that the two electrons on the double site are in the spin singlet state due to , i assume , pauli exclusion . however the two electrons are not in the same energy level - they are separated by u so why is there a restriction on their spins ?
discourse analysis of japanese particles ? <eos> have there been any english language attempts ( preferably readily-available ) to define japanese particles from the perspective of discourse analysis ? some of the things i would be interested to see such an analysis of : the use of sentence-ending particles such as na , no , ne , yo , etc . the use of focus and emphasis particles such as zo whether an explicit subject is represented using wa or ga whether wa/ga/wo are explicitly stated ( most common ) or are `` dropped '' and their noun phrases bare in a clause ( grammatical in some contexts )
how can i find good tactics problems ? <eos> say you have a database of a lot of games . how would you go about finding good tactics problems ? i suppose you would search until there was a spot where the score shifted , and there was only one good move on the previous move . but that is n't the whole story , sometimes you need to go back a couple of moves to find where the tactic really started . for now , ideas of how to do this manually is fine ( with the help of an analysis engine ) , but automating this process is the idea .

does japanese have determiners ? <eos> it 's generally established that japanese does not have the grammatical category of articles ( akin to english `` a/an '' and `` the '' ) . but as mentioned in this answer , the concept of articles seems to be something fairly whimsical that came out of classical language grammar , with a much more coherent and broader category of determiners being a more modern approach . given this additional breadth of the determiner category can it be said that japanese has determiners ? in the analyses of japanese i am familiar with i have never seen this . but perhaps this is a difference between traditional grammars used for teaching and modern grammar/syntax theories used by linguistics .

do people who lift weights twice per week need less protein than people who lift three times per week ? <eos> several exercise programs i 've seen suggest lifting weights DIGIT times per week , but also say that progress can me made by only lifting twice per week ( although it will be slower ) . these sorts of programs also suggest eating large amounts of protein . i 've heard various numbers , although DIGIT gram of protein per pound of body weight ( or of lean bodyweight ) is a common one . but regardless of how much protein you require when following a 3-times-per-week lifting program , my question is this : if you 're only training DIGIT times per week and aiming for gains at a slower pace , do you need less protein ? i would think so but i want to be sure .

( why ) is it difficult to merge and split wallet.dat ? <eos> it is a common question , how to sync a wallet across different devices . as far as i understand , a wallet is just a collection of private keys . each private key can be uniquely identified using the bitcoin address associated with the key . thus , why do n't we think of wallet.dat as if it was a directory : filename file content =address =private key 1hb5xmlmzfv 8alj6mfbsbifro ... ... now , syncing such a directory is trivial . if the filename ( address ) matches , the file is identical and does not need to be synced . if a filename is only present on one side , just copy the file , it 's a new address . is something like this going to be implemented in a future client version ? or is my idea faulty ?

remixing for the internet ? <eos> i was wondering if there were any quick approaches from taking a soundtrack that has a wide dynamic range ( film ) and compressing it for something like the internet , where most things seem to be squashed ? using a limiter or any excessive amount of compression obviously kills the large peaks and kills some of the more intense moments . maybe it 's best to just leave the mix as is ? if i come off ignorant , i completely am . i do n't have much experience with film and i was hoping to find a quick solution without having to do a complete remix . thoughts ?

can a school provide preferential treatment for one allergen and not another ? <eos> our daughter is allergic to dairy milk . we provide her almond milk at home , however our school has told us we can not bring in almond milk due to concerns about nut allergies , and that we should provide soy milk instead . we do not want our daughter drinking soy milk and feel that the school 's policy is discriminatory due to the fact that both soy and dairy are potential allergens and they are allowing those , while banning nuts . therefore they are providing preferential treatment for children with one medical condition while not providing the same considerations/protections for children with another medical condition . are we correct in our assessment that this is a discriminatory practice ? we are willing to work with the school to develop sane practices based on cdc recommendations , such as allergy-free tables in the lunchroom , etc .

starting a liquid fuel engine in zero gravity <eos> in zero gravity , the liquid in a fuel tank tends to form a blob in a random location , so you 'd have to take precautions to make sure the fuel pump can draw fuel . in a recent question about spinning spacecraft , @ erik suggested that spinning can be used to get the fuel in place for an engine start . but if you spin a spacecraft along its thrust axis , the fuel ends up towards the outside of the craft , or at DIGIT degrees relative to the thrust line . so when you start the engine , the fuel will move violently towards the engine , potentially ( if the fuel tank is less than DIGIT filled ) moving away from the fuel intake . how is this done in practice ?

garden hoses : how safe are they ? <eos> after noticing that some garden hoses carry a warning , `` not to be used for drinking water '' , i recently switched to one labelled `` non-toxic '' . does this only mean that the hose is lead-free , or also that it is free of the other chemicals in pvc that are thought to cause cancer ? those of us who grow our crops organically , believe that they are ( relatively ) uncontaminated . are we unwittingly introducing harmful chemicals into the food chain , every time we water our fruit and vegetables ? does anyone know if there has been any research into this , and how safe our hoses are ?

do any spacecraft use gnss for attitude determination ? <eos> in principle , by placing a gnss-receiver on all extremities of a spacecraft ( or aircraft , for that matter ) , one can determine the orientation of the satellite . google lists some studies , but have such systems been used in real spacecraft ? on the one hand , i 'd think cubesats might go for such a low-cost solution , on the other hand , the smaller the spacecraft , the larger the error in attitude determination by using gnss . the technique is not listed on the wikipedia page on attitude control . has this been used in practice at all ?
how would weather change on a tidally-locked terrestrial planet ? <eos> on earth , weather is very much affected by the earth 's rotation around its axis and around the sun . even locations that are almost on the equator do have strong annual variations in precipitation and other characteristics . on the other hand , on a tidally-locked planet ( tlp ) , there are no cycles . the star is still on one place on the sky . from the point of view of the global circulation models , which are most often used for studies of the climate of tlp , this is an ideal steady state . my question is : what weather changes and cycles should one expect on tidally-locked planets , where no astronomical cycle acts as external forcing ? would the weather in a particular location change at all ?

solution based measurement of solvent-accessible surface area of macromolecules <eos> the solvent-accessible surface area ( sasa ) is a valuable metric for looking at protein folding and protein-protein interactions . however , this measurement is typically done by calculating the sasa from a solved ( and generally static ) structure . chemical probes like diazirine and hydroxyl radicals show some bias regarding where they tend to bind . i 'm realizing while i 'm writing this question that nmr is a perfectly valid method to determine a solution based structure and then calculate the sasa . similar strategies has also been used to examine structured rnas . i 'm curious about the variety of these methods and how accurate they are .

simple algorithm effectiveness ( least-squares regression line in terms of sample variances ) <eos> i hope i 'm at right place , as i asked this question at stackoverflow.com where the question was closed and suggested i go ask here . i 'll try to be more comprehensive also , looking at couple of replies i got there . the question is simple for those who know how algorithms work , and as i 'm physics student i 'm not sure about the answer . i had exam in statistics where professor suggested that formula i used ( red outlined ) in determining `` least-squares regression line '' was computationally inferior to the one derived below ( green outline ) . my simple thinking was that first one uses n squares while derived ( n+1 ) squares , but supposedly that 's not enough . can someone point why could derived formula be computationally more effective ? thanks
where did latin and its descendants retain a case system most recently ? <eos> so we know that latin nouns and adjectives inflect for case as well as person , number , and gender . also we know that all the major modern romance languages except romanian no longer have a case system . i believe it 's been judged that romanian 's case system is not a direct descendent from the latin but a later innovation just as its neuter gender is not descended from that of latin - but i could be wrong on some of this . so my question is , which romance language , or which variety of vulgar latin is believed to be the one that retained a case system directly inherited from latin the longest ? ( if i 'm wrong about romanian please show the direct relationship or provide references . )
do stencil tests use any acceleration techniques ? <eos> stencil bits are often used for optimizations , for instance having full screen lighting passes only affect certain pixels . does the stencil test mechanism use any acceleration structures of any kind ( like maybe dividing the screen into a coarser grid ? ) or do the perf benefits come solely from having a pre-pixel shader test that can early out waves of shaders ?

are there languages for which postures are very important ? <eos> many speculative fiction works have languages that depend to a great deal on the postures of the people communicating . some examples are the language of the adem in patrick rothfuss ' the wise man 's fears and the language of the khai in daniel abraham 's long price quartet . are there any such languages in the real world ? edit : to be clear , the common thread in both the languages is that the gestures are a formal part of the language . the words have lesser amounts of tone in them , and each sentence is supposed to be accompanied by a gesture . there are gestures which are very subtle , like 'polite but adamant refusal ' . also , it 's expected for people to reply with gestures instead of small sentences etc .

how do i accept bitcoin payments at a real world store ? <eos> from what i understand , there are some requirements for using bitcoins at a physical store : both the store owner and the client must have internet access the client must have a cellphone or a laptop to issue the payment the seller must have a way to confirm that the coins were sent . the biggest problem is the confirmation . since it is risky to accept transactions with DIGIT confirmations , it will take around DIGIT minutes before a single confirmation occurs and allows the real world transaction to be completed . the more confirmations that occur , the less risky it is . that said , what is the best way for a store owner to securely accept bitcoins ?

why does the u.s grant visas via lottery ? <eos> it is reasonable to grant a visa for education or investment but granting it by chance seems odd . i 'm not sure if any other country does the same but there should be reason ( s ) for this ( except giving a chance to people from undeveloped countries to have a better life ) . some guess : a scientific reason could be bypassing human-made rules ( visa rules ) which may prevent special kind of people come to u.s , in this interpretation lottery visa acts like what mutation does in biology . a reason which if mentioned may cause my first question get closed . is it known to public why such type of visa is offered by u.s government ( benefits for u.s not immigrants ) ? any theories ?
is buddhism a fear-based religion ? <eos> my general observation about religions is that they have this fundamental assumption of fear of something . for example , fear of punishment or getting into hell is present in many religions . buddhism too has this fear of rebirth in lower realms , but also a fear of getting into sadness ( dukkha ? ) these days people of modern outlook tend to discount such fears as childish and practically useless . while a philosophy that distinguishes between harmful and beneficial will still be valid to a general society even after religions disappear . how can buddhism be helpful to a secular society that does not have any irrational fear of hell or getting into sadness ? additionally , how can buddhism be useful to a practical society concerned with real harm and benefit ?

is the qmax of an t-beam equal if calculated both above and below the neutral plane ? <eos> i was doing a question involving a t-beam question wrong since i was selecting the wrong area to use for $ q_ { max } $ when trying to maximise the shear stress . $ $ large { tau } = frac { vq } { it } $ $ a friend argued that the area both above and below the neutral axis should be equal but despite trying multiple times , i have been unable to get the same result . is this statement correct ? ( and if not , why ) it would seem by argument of equal values both above and below the beam that perhaps it would be correct , even if the beam is unsymmetrical .
how to characterize gaseous ethylene that forms as byproduct ? <eos> i 'm running a reaction that has ethylene gas as a byproduct . i have observed gas evolution as my reaction proceeded and i have other ways of verifying the identity of the main product , but i thought it might be cool if i could also test for the presence of ethylene . are there any simple tests i can use for this purpose ? obviously it is not easy to detect since it 's a fairly non-reactive gas , so it does n't have to have DIGIT specificity .
what are prominent pro-war 20th century philosphers ? <eos> i 'm asking from a sociological perspective here . motivation : i wonder if it is true that technological development is better during war time , and if so , why ? is it because the review process is different/faster ? is it because people are forced to work together ? forced by whom ? 20th century history has had some `` geniuses '' , but then again it seems that these people might just have had the advantage of being brought together ( e.g . in the manhattan project , where feynman gets to meet von neuman ) . i do n't think i 'm the first to make this conjecture , and so i wonder if there have ever been people making this point to support a pro-war agenda .

what is the precise meaning of anatta ? <eos> this is focusing in on one specific aspect of what was asked here : what are the three marks of existence ? i often hear `` anatta '' explained as being an expression of the non-existence of the self . however , various places add an adjective first . for example , i 've heard it said that anatta refers to the non-existence of a `` permanent '' self , or a `` material '' self , or a `` separate '' self ( or some combination of those and others ) . it seems clear to me that it can not mean the non-existence of a self per se , because such a statement -- `` there is no self '' -- would be auto-refuting . so exactly what is meant by anatta ?

why are neutrino oscillations considered to be `` beyond the standard model '' ? <eos> is this just a historical artifact - that the particle physics community decided at some point to call all of the pre-oscillation physics by the name the `` standard model '' ? the reason i ask is because i often see articles and books say something to the effect `` the strongest hint of physics beyond the sm are the non-zero neutrino masses '' as if this is something significant and mysterious - whereas from what i gathered from the answer to a question i asked previously , lepton mixing is something natural and unsurprising . so why are n't neutrino oscillations considered part of the sm ? i am not asking out of any sociological interest but because i want to make sure i have n't underestimated the significance of the discovery of neutrino oscillations .

mayan calendar coinciding with winter solstice <eos> it appears that all anyone has been talking about is the end of the world , misinterpretations aside ( at least i hope so ) my understanding that this is simply the end of an age of the mayan calendar . given the mayans were great astronomers and ( i believe ) their calendar to be based on the stars is there a reason that the age ends on the winter solstice ( 21/12/2012 ) or is it just coincidence ?

why are two earls the rankiest of all ? <eos> in iolanthe , by gilbert and sullivan , phyllis sings ( after discovering the `` betrayal '' ) : so the richest and rankiest of you all my sorrowful heart shall choose . then : i 'll be a countess , shall i not ? and the peers say : rank , it seems , is vital , `` countess '' is the title , yes , countess , countess the title , the title , yet the only candidates are two earls which seems a bit odd , given that half the house courts her . i see a few options : no dukes or marquesses are available . she just picked a title ( and nobody wished to contest that ) . marchioness would n't fit in the song and duchess would be unrealistic . but perhaps i 'm missing some historical context or a subtle joke ?
existentialism and the absensce of free will <eos> one of the most famous doctrines of existentialism formulated by jean paul sartre is that we are absolutely free . man is condemned to be free ; because once thrown into the world , he is responsible for everything he does . ( j.p. sartre , being and nothingness ) this seems to contradict modern notions of the absence of free will , at least when sartre 's doctrine is interpreted metaphysically . however , existentialism still seems useful to me as a form of `` life philosophy '' . it seems to me that the recognition of the absence of free will is good , especially in policy making , but that we , as individuals , must still lead our lives as if we have free will . my question is : has anyone `` merged '' existentialist thought with the idea of absence of free will ?

send “ thank you ” email after phone interview ? <eos> i just had a technical interview over the phone with a manager for a programming job i 'm applying to . the company deals heavily with open source , and the phone interview was friendly and rather informal ( this does n't mean unprofessional ! we had some good talk about code , technologies , etc ) so i was wondering if sending a `` thank you '' email afterwards would be appropriate . by doing a quick search this seems to be the recommended thing to do , but most of these `` job search '' sites seem to apply to positions not technical or related to programming , but rather marketing , business , etc . so i 'm having some doubts whether this would be seen as rather lame or unnecessary .

what is top n % of hands in pokerstove ? <eos> in pokerstove faq ; the slider interface for setting the top n % of hands orders the hands according to their preflop all-in equity versus three random hands . this rather arbitrary selection was picked because it balances the value of high cards with the value of drawing cards . it is not an absolute ordering , and depending on the specific situation you may want to edit that range of hands when doing equity calculations . so , what is exactly n % ? is it equal to vpip/pfr ? how can i calculate this statistic healthy ?

algorithmically determining the rainy season <eos> i have historical precipitation data for hundreds of cities around the world . i would like to algorithmically determine when the rainy season ( if exists ) is for each location . are there any algorithms out there that can determine this based on the monthly averages alone ? some problems that i envision are : having a lot of rain is not enough . many places in south east asia have very heavy rain falls for a couple of minutes a day , but it still is not necessarily considered rainy season . is it better to say that if the weather is x standard deviations above the average precipitation that it is rainy season or use a moving average ? any other ideas , links , etc ? i 'm brand new to the field so help and an open discussion would be appreciated .
must explanatory mathematical systems of the world lead to infinite regress ? <eos> call the world as it presents itself to us world-1 the regularity & amp ; order in the world demands explanation - hence we have a mathematically consistent description of the world . call this world-2 . but surely the same situation again applies here : that the regularity & amp ; order is manifestly displayed in world-2 demands an explanation . suppose that this is another mathematically consistent explanation for this . call this world-3 . and so on . we appear to have an infinite regress . does this mean that any mathematical description of the world can never be complete in itself ? a rough example of this is the description of our own universe in the standard model . then the explanation of fine-tuning demands explanation - some treatments consider then the perspective of a larger multiverse .

better understanding the pyrolysis reaction <eos> i 'm no chemist , but much of my work revolves around biochar . i 've always understood it with the following rough approximation : $ $ ce { ch2o ( dry plant matter ) + heat - & gt ; black carbon + h2 + co + ch4 + hydrocarbons } $ $ i 've got two questions : is the above a decent approximation ? in what ways is it misleading ( as all approximations always are ) ? a colleague recently told me that methane is only formed in this reaction when there is water vapor present -- he said that it mixes with co at high temperature to form the methane . is this true ? will one not get any methane from oven-dried biomass that is exposed to heat in the absence of oxygen ?

how many stickers need to be cycled on a rubik 's cube before the chance it 's unsolvable drops below 11/12 ? <eos> this is a question i 'm actually looking for the answer to . it 's known that when you swap individual pieces on a rubik 's cube , the probability that afterwards it will be possible to solve is DIGIT say that you take all the possible combinations of cycling n stickers simultaneously . by the amount of cycled stickers , i mean the minimum amount of stickers you need to cycle to make that combination . what is the largest n that the probability of this cube being impossible to solve is greater than 11/12 ? is there a way to do this without brute forcing it ? is there no limit ?

electricity generated by the body and its applications ? <eos> i recently came across this article from nature . in it , it states that the snails have `` tiny biofuel cells that extract electrical power from the glucose and oxygen in the snail ’ s blood '' , and that the power obtained is dependent on `` how quickly sugar and oxygen can be taken from the creatures ' blood '' . they go on to say that the power obtained decreases over time , and that these implants could power future pacemakers in humans . would this application in humans require that a patient eats more and `` breathes more '' than average ? why does the power output decrease over time , and could n't that potentially lead to the malfunctioning of a pacemaker ? references van noorden , richard . “ cyborg snails power up. ” nature ( march 12 , 2012 ) .

is vigorous drumming an effective exercise ? <eos> from the `` any exercise is better than no exercise '' perspective , i 'd imagine that playing drums at high tempo would be considered effective - it certainly can work up a sweat and obviously must burn more calories than just sitting on the couch , but it 's hard to say how effective it actually is without hard numbers . are there any reliable sources which can provide met or actual calorie burn data by which we could compare drumming with other exercises ? also , while it 's obviously physically taxing beyond a certain level of skill , does drumming actually raise the heart rate enough to really count as cardio ?

in orbital hybridisation , what determines the number of orbitals that hybridise to be at the same energy level ? <eos> for example , in phosphorus pentachloride five orbitals hybridize , but why not 6 , as in the hydrated al ion ? i have read that the reason six orbitals hybridize is that a maximum of six oxygens can stably fit around it . why is it not the same case for phosphorus ? secondly , why does water $ sp^3 $ hybridize even though it has enough lone pairs in its p orbital to bond with DIGIT oxygens . surely it would take more energy to pull up the lower $ s $ orbital to bond than to allow the $ p $ 's , already elevated to that energy , to do the bonding ?

sankharas , once eliminated . do they have a chance of coming back ? <eos> when i talk of sankharas , i mean the pattern of the mind and the way in which the sanna recognizes an object . after prolonged vipassana and remaining equanimous to the body sensations , many of my thought patterns have changed and i can practically see a link there . but theoretically i am still unaware as to how remaining equanimous to body sensations has anything to do with the deepest habit patterns of the mind . now my question is if one stops vipassana meditation for a sufficient period of time . is there a way for these sankharas to develop again ?

when interviewing , is it prudent to tell the hiring manager that you 're a parent and your spouse works full-time ? <eos> these days , many households include two parents who both work full-time . these parents face many challenges while balancing work and child-care responsibilities . but this situation also presents a challenge for each parent 's employer . for instance , when children reach school-age , one parent is typically obliged to pick up each child from school ( s ) ; and so , that parent may be entirely unable to work overtime . and when a school-age child is sick , one parent may need to stay home . so my question is : when interviewing , is it prudent to tell the hiring manager that you 're a parent and your spouse works full-time ?

technical question about foley <eos> this one is kind of a question that spawned from a project i 'm working on and reading the last question on foley . here 's a technical question for foley artists : how much do you , or a typical foley artist , rely on knowledge of how the mic works . do you perform to the mic and work it like a vocalist will or do you just do your thing and let the recordist do as he sees fit . do you prefer different microphones for different things or is that left up to the foley recordist ?

are there any non-paywalled reputable economics journals ? <eos> i 'm contributing to another open-source economics project , and was looking to compile a list of primary sources for modern developments in the field . basically something to help bridge the ( occasionally decades long ) time lag between what 's taught at an undergrad/ introductory grad level and what 's being researched in the field today . unfortunately as many in academia know , companies like elsevier and others have most major publications locked up behind corporate paywalls , which makes them broadly incompatible with the principles of oss/osd . there 's arxiv ( and vixra for the braver ) , but preprint servers are not really what i 'm looking for . it 's hard to separate the wheat from the chaff on many of them . i 'd like something with some editorial content , and especially peer-review . i 'd appreciate any suggestions .
are pontoon bridges being considered to extend bridge span ? <eos> pontoon bridges differ from traditional bridges in that they are supported not by structures anchored to the floor of the body being spanned but by floating pontoons that are connected by a more rigid structure that supports a roadway . they 're often used by militaries to provide a temporary crossing point , but they 're also used for permanent civilian crossings . i would assume that they make it easier to cross larger bodies of water because there is less structure to be secured below the surface . in areas of deep water , support structures can become unfeasibly large . these larger spans could , though , make the pontoon bridges susceptible to damage from strong winds and currents . are there plans to use pontoon bridges to cross long distances ?

can a rabbit be scared to death ? <eos> i have heard several times about rabbits being kept in outdoor cages where , a dog or other predator barked and/or scratched at the cage . the person came out and found the rabbit ( s ) dead in a still secure cage . the assumption generally relaid in this scenario is that the when the predator came up , the rabbit was scared to death ( implying a quick death ) . another possibility is that the predator had made multiple threats to the caged rabbit , and it died of long term stress ( or other ) health related issues . i am looking for to prove or disprove that a rabbit can be suddenly `` scared to death '' . where death follows with seconds or at most a few minutes of from an initial encounter .

how can i evaluate how poor a fit a parametric var result would be for a given holding ? <eos> i 'm currently working on an application that , among other things , computes a one-day parametric var for security positions . i understand that the parametric method of computing var is a poor fit for non-linear instruments , such as options and fixed income . thus my question : how can i evaluate how poor a fit a parametric var result would be for a given holding ? i 'm interested in both rules of thumb - for example , `` credit default swaps are always a poor fit for a parametric var computation '' and guidelines , such as `` fixed income securities become increasingly non-linear as duration increases , and are a poor fit for a parametric var computation once duration is above x '' i have no idea if either of those statements are true . i made them up .

objections to total surplus as tool for welfare measurement <eos> i think people would agree that the most common tool for welfare measurements in economics is the notion of total surplus . throughout it 's history , total surplus has been criticized several times and on different grounds . this post aims at being a repository of all those critiques . which are the critiques of total surplus which seem the most relevant to you ? note : this is not meant to be a `` total surplus bashing '' repository . i believe some of the best critique of a concept like total surplus are rarely the one attempting to destroy the concept , and more often those which help us understand when it is best to use it , and when it might be better not to use it .

how do i learn a new opening ? <eos> often times , when i find myself going through the lines of a new opening , one that i would like to start using in my games i hit the concrete wall after a couple of days of studying it . due to the fact that this is new to me , i simply do n't understand every strategic line behind it , and since i 've never played it i do n't know what to expect in a real game . so my question is : during the first stage of leaning a new opening , just memorize the different possible variations ? or deep dive in the theory behind each move until you acquire a thorough comprehension of the tactical and strategical motifs ?
blowing low notes on the transverse flute <eos> i recently acquired a concert flute and started to play with it , getting used to the embouchure and properly making a sound . i reached a certain stopping point when trying to learn all by myself , though . i can make all the notes from the first octave sound properly , with a couple of tries , except the the ones ranging from d - > c # - > c. i blow the flute but the sound is fickle , and very , very quiet , i can hardly `` spot '' it over the sound of me blowing across the little flute hole . am i missing something when related to embouchure ? should it change to properly address the lower notes on the instrument ? maybe i need to direct the flow or the speed of the air differently ?

gold nanoparticles in a water/oil environment <eos> i am currently investigating the assembly of gold nanoparticles in a mixture of water and oil . the thing is the following : if we have gold nanoparticles ( 35nm diameter ) dispersed in water and we put some oil on it . after that we shake it , then the gold will be kept between the layer between water and oil and now i was wondering why this happens . so why is it not possible that the gold nanoparticles stay solely in the water or go over in the oil completely ? or it could be possible that the gold particles agglomerate , why does this not happen ? or maybe it does happen and i do not know this . does somebody have some background information on this topic ?

how to tune the pid parameters using fuzzy logic ? <eos> i previously used the ziegler method to tune the parameters of my pid controller to control my robot 's position . i then implemented fuzzy logic for self-tuning the parameters . i have two inputs to the fuzzy logic controller ; one is the position error and the error rate . i know that my problem might be due to not understanding the effect of each parameter very well . the problem is that i am confused in setting up the fuzzy rules . when do i need to use high and low values for kp , kd and ki to achieve the best tuning ? is it that kp must be very low when the error is almost zero ( hence , the robot is at the desired position ) ? the same question applies for all of the three parameters .

why do eukaryotic organisms have introns in their dna ? <eos> we touched on introns and exons in my bio class , but unfortunately we did n't really talk about why eukaryotes have introns . it would seem they would have to have some purpose since prokaryotes do not have them and they evolved first chronologically , but i could easily be wrong . did the junk sections of dna just evolve there by some sort of randomness or necessity as opposed to an actual evolutionary advantage ? why has n't evolution stopped us from having introns since they seem to be a 'waste ' of time and dna ? why do prokaryotes not have introns ?

why did somalia fail as a state , and what keeps it from coming back ? <eos> when considering a list of `` failed '' states , yemen , afghanistan , and somalia are usually considered the textbook examples ( see fragile states index , 2012 ) . yemen seems to have crawled back on its own after a nasty civil war , and afghanistan failed because it was left in a vacuum from one superpower , only to be `` protected '' by another . but what is about about somalia that caused it to fail , and , unlike the other two , seem to be stuck in such a state for so long ? what factors have kept a functioning government from taking hold , or barring that , having it dissolve into smaller states that could co-exist ?

where does the pythagorean theorem `` fit '' within modern mathematics ? <eos> i am interested in how today 's professional mathematicians view the pythagorean theorem , in terms of how the theorem fits within the axiomatic framework of mathematics . i often come across textbooks that define length by the pythagorean theorem , so that the theorem is in essence a definition or axiom . in more modern mathematics such as linear algebra , is the pythagorean theorem generally just used as the definition of length ? is it more conventional today to treat the pythagorean theorem as a definition ( or axiom ) rather than a theorem ? are there any modern proofs of the pythagorean theorem that do n't rely on euclidean geometry ( like a proof that utilizes linear algebra/the dot product , etc . ) ?

what is the main purpose of the foam inside a self-inflating mat ? <eos> all self-inflating mats i have seen are self-inflating in the sense that you ’ re supposed to inflate them yourself .

bosonic m-theory and moonshine gravity <eos> last month i asked about a 27-dimensional origin of the heterotic string . now i 'm looking at witten 's `` three-dimensional gravity revisited '' , where he proposes that pure gravity on ads3 is dual to the `` monstrous moonshine '' cft , which is bosonic string theory on a `` leech lattice '' orbifold . would n't that mean we were also talking about bosonic m-theory ( the 27-dimensional theory ) on ads3 x r24/λ24 ? but that would mean that on this occasion , the emergence of the `` m '' dimension was the same thing as the emergence of the radial ads dimension . does that even make sense ?

microwaving supper for the children in a filthy microwave <eos> this is a hypothetical question , but i could see it happening to me one day . a father uses a public microwave oven to cook supper to feed his children . the microwave is technically clean , but he is nervous that the `` fumes '' from other dishes previously cooked in there will `` contaminate '' the meals of his young ones . after realizing that he wants his kids to eat healthier , he decides that he wants to take action . he wonders if it is safe to double-wrap the food in saran wrap or possibly some other material . should he do this ? it might be unsafe and would release plastic toxins into the food if not cause a fire in the microwave ? however , if it is safe , then what is the best material to use for the wrapping ?

inductive reasoning and justification <eos> most people agree that knowing something one acquired from inductive reasoning is knowledge , that is justified true belief . for example we observed for years , that sun rises from the east , we still claim that `` we know , that tomorrow sun will rise from the east '' , even if from epistemological point of view this position is not justified neither via evidentialism nor via reliabilism . basically , something is n't true yet , but there is an ultra-high probability of truthfulness , and there is also no justification , yet we call it knowledge . does that mean that any conclusion got from inductive reasoning is strictly speaking not knowledge ? how do epistemologists call and explain this phenomenon ?

stronglifts 5x5 : an effective program ? <eos> i was recently looking through the stronglifts 5x5 workout , and i was wondering about its effectiveness . the program has some lofty claims ( most do ) , has a ton of anecdotal evidence supporting it , and appears to be quite successful given their `` 15 million visitors and DIGIT thousand members . '' that being said , the nerd in me really wants to understand why something works , and the site did n't really communicate that point . before i spend DIGIT weeks on what could be just another `` fad routine , '' i was wondering if anyone knew of any research or studies done on the stronglift routine , and whether or not the program 's effectiveness can be scientifically proven or refuted .

given the well known effects of the inverse turbulence cascade for 2d flow , does it make sense to use grid resolutions that resolve turbulence ? <eos> as is well known , 2d simulations of turbulent flows in the ocean follow an inverse energy cascade , as opposed to a forward energy cascade observed in fully 3d flows . because in 2d fluid filamentation is enhanced leading to strong density gradients that eventually become grid scale ( where most of the mixing is owed to numerical mixing ) , the dissipation is underpredicted while mixing is overpredicted . as such , is there any value to running a 2d simulation with resolutions that attempt to resolve turbulence ?

can learning sign language be harmful for babies ' speech development ? <eos> possible duplicate : does using sign language really accelerate a child & # 39 ; s ability to speak ? i am considering teaching my 8-month-old sign language , and i ca n't sneeze without finding resources extolling the virtues of sign language for babies ( most of which use subjective arguments , like easing you baby 's frustration ) . however , i worry that signs could end up as a `` crutch '' , and might hinder my daughter 's verbal speech , and maybe even hinder her communication in general ( verbal or nonverbal ) . are there any actual studies showing that teaching babies sign language is helpful ? even a study that concludes it does n't hurt would make me feel better .

i do n't understand the central-control difference between DIGIT e4 and DIGIT e3 <eos> the books/articles tell me that the center is d4 , d5 , e4 , and e5 . DIGIT e4 controls d5 , but DIGIT e3 controls d4 . both control one square in the center , no ? yet DIGIT e4 is apparently a vast improvement over DIGIT e3 . how would occupying e4 make a difference ? surely a pawn does n't control the square it 's on but rather the squares on which it can capture ? i really wish these books/articles aimed at amateurs would be more precisely formulated . there 's just way too much frustrating handwaving . surely i 'm not the only amateur who 's had this confusion .

lean , ux or agile , which one is the most essential to introduce first into a startup <eos> there has been plenty of talk and discussion about the importance of lean , ux and agile in developing software products and services in startup companies . each of these areas require a lot of investment in time and resources , and for a startup to do all three at once seems like a big gap to bridge . does anyone have experience with introducing these approaches and practices into startups , and in what order should they be introduced to ensure that the business is not overwhelmed and under resourced to operate effectively . my guess is that for a digital product/service related business , you would start with a lean business structure/model , then create an agile software development team that designs and refines the product using ux practices .

using poly wav files in logic studio DIGIT <eos> so i just mirrored DIGIT gigs of poly wav files ( 6 - DIGIT channel bwfs ) from my deva in 192k . i 'm not running pthd at home , so i ca n't run pt in 192k at home . i can run logic at home at 192k , but for some reason logic does n't like my poly wavs . i 've had this problem before , but i 've never had to deal with it at 192k . logic is interpreting my files as surround files , so it brings all the channels into DIGIT track and assigns them to a surround panner . then it wo n't let me break them each out to separate channels . any ideas ? anyone run into this problem in logic ? how did you rectify it ?

is there a relationship between efficiency of cellular metabolism and warm-blooded-ness ? <eos> my bio DIGIT book states that when human cells convert glucose to atp , the process is only approx DIGIT efficient , and much of the potential energy is lost as heat . however , that heat is useful to us in maintaining our overall body temperature . cold-blooded animals ( reptiles , for example ) are not as effective at maintaining their own body temperature . does that imply that their cellular metabolism ( conversion of glucose to atp ) is more efficient than humans , and thus does n't produce as much heat ? or is cold-blooded- / warm-blooded-ness completely unrelated to heat released during cellular metabolism ?

is linux more sustainable than windows ? <eos> one of the many advantages of gnu/linux systems , and probably *nix in general , is that they can run on older and lesser hardware than the children of microsoft can , i.e . has lower `` system requirements '' . a similar sentiment about linux is expressed in this question . it seems reasonable to think that power cosumption and even wear of the hardware is lower in *nix compared to windows . is this true or at least plausible ? i 'm also interested what other effects there may be . in fact , i found one article that says linux servers on average run twice longer ( ~6-8yrs ) that windows ones ( ~3yrs ) . or , if this is a more viable/correct question : is some software more sustainable than other for the same task ?

what fallacy or branch of philosophy is this ? <eos> i 've recently been critiquing some fluffy answers on another stack exchange and i been encountering this type of fluffy evasive answer : the question asks about the future ; all future is unpredictable ; ergo the answer is unknowable ; ergo the question is a pineapple . but i ca n't quite put my finger on what fallacy or branch of philosophy they are using to make this evasive statement . edit : i 've tightened up the question by changing proposition `` the future is unpredictable '' to `` all future is unpredictable '' as on further reflection almost all the non sequiturs i 've encountered are evasively implying the question ca n't be answered on principle than on question specifics .

what 's the point of having thousands of nuclear missiles ? <eos> according to wikipedia , the us and russia has close to 8,000 nuclear warheads each . other known nuclear powers , the uk , france , china , india , pakistan and israel has a couple of hundreds each . the cold war numbers were even higher , at some point the us and the ussr peaked at more than 30,000 nuclear warheads . what is the rationale of having such a large number ? nuclear weapons cost a lot to maintain and secure , so the benefits must be huge to justify this cost . given the devastating effect of nuclear attacks , after a couple of dozens attack the enemy country would be decapitated , and the entire earth would probably be subject to dangerous radiation , which would make further nuclear attacks irrelevant or undesirable , right ?

what would constitute a reasonable expectation of privacy ? <eos> to some degree this is presumably a legal question , but my question is really trying to ask about the principle here . i guess the core question is about what expectations a `` reasonable '' agent might be construed to have as regards privacy . the edge case where even consciousness is somehow public and legible is what particularly interests me here , though . what if any might the ethical implications be of inspecting a sentient machines ' code , or perhaps more provocatively , somehow directly inspecting its `` qualia '' while it 's running ? ( though presumably at this post-singularity point , many of the ethical referents that sustain an individual expectation of privacy would have mutated irrecognizably ... )

lifespan of connective tissue cells <eos> this post is regarding a follow up on my initial post on `` properties and life cycle of chondrocytes and tenocytes '' . i am elaborating on my question on the lifespan of tenocytes and chondrocytes . from what i have read , tenocytes and chondrocytes form from mature stem cells , more specifically mesenchymal stem cells . these cells can replicate through mitosis , and are present in the body in different tissues like bone marrow . these cells are the key in the regeneration of diverse tissues . when the cells that inhabit tendons or cartilage die , do new ms cells travel to the tendon or cartilage area and diffentiate into a new tenocyte or chondrocyte ? are tenocytes and chondrocytes continuously replaced ?

should i respond to `` fussing '' the same as crying in an infant ? <eos> during the night my 7-week-old will fuss in his sleep ( grunt , flail , etc ... ) . this fussing rarely proceeds to crying but he usually will not settle on his own . when i pick him up he will usually settle down and most of the time he is wet . i typically treat this fussing the same as all out crying and respond to him immediately but it has been suggested to me that i may want to let him `` fuss it out '' for a while so learns to settle himself down ( or at least until he starts crying ) . should i treat fussing the same as crying ? thank you .

can loop quantum gravity connect in any way with string theory ? <eos> the one difficulty i see with lqg is that it requires an enormous number of degrees of freedom , e.g . these spin variables in the net . this is in contrast to stringy holographic theory where the fields in a space are equivalent to fields on a boundary or a horizon of one dimension lower . in this setting entropy of a black hole is the entanglement entropy of states interior and exterior to the black hole . this reduces the amount of data , and thus entropy , required . are there suggestions , conjectures or maybe serious theory which attempts to describe the spin variables of lqg according to such entanglements in string-brane theory ?

orthonormalization of damping matrix -- modal analysis <eos> in my mechanical vibrations class we studied the method to orthonormalize a set of differential equations by the mass matrix ( principle coordinates ) . this is where you take the matrix of eigenvectors from the un-damped system and normalize it by the mass matrix . multiplying the mass matrix by the modal matrix gives : x'mx = i and multiplying the stiffness matrix by the modal matrix gives : x'kx = w^2 ( ii ) where w^2 ( ii ) is the matrix of squared natural frequencies . my question is : is it appropriate to try and orthonormalize the damping matrix in the same fashion ? x'cx = 2*zeta*omega ( ii ) should this transform the system 's damping into principle coordinates ?

can i use imus to improve the position/posture measurement of fingers in a `` data glove '' ? <eos> i have been using the cyberglove to control a humanoid robot hand , but found it disappointing as it does n't measure the posture of the human hand very accurately . i have been wondering about the possibility of using inertial measurement units ( imus ) mounted on the fingers to track position and measure posture . but i 'm not sure how feasible it is . would an imu return enough data to make tracking reliable in all circumstances ? would it be possible to fool the system into incorrectly tracking the fingers ? might it be possible to get away with using simple 3-axis accelerometers , or would it need 9-axis ( accelerometer , gyro , and magnetometer ) ?
eating more and still losing weight <eos> i started regular exercising a few months back ( after years of being not so active ) . i have now been regularly spending 1h on the treadmill every other day and started losing weight . i am of course controlling my diet generally speaking eating oatmeal and milk , lean meat , fruit and as fat only olive oil and eating almost zero sugars ( i think oatmeal and bananas help keep refined sugar away ) . the thing is that sometimes , although i am not really strict ( eating too much parmesan or too much white bread ) on my eating habits i still lose weight . what 's the logic at work here ? my body was almost asleep and now that my basic metabolism has started i am forgiven for some little mistakes ?
which countries , if any , offer on-arrival work visas ? <eos> after seeing this question i began wondering - are there countries that say , aussies or kiwis ( or anyone else ) can get a work visa on arrival , or while in the country ? the best i 've found is this : URL which indicates availability of working holiday programs , but for several of them ( argentina for example ) you are required to apply to wellington ( in my case ) before being accepted . chile , on the other hand , you ca n't get one on arrival , but you can apply for one while being a tourist in the country . so a chart or definitive source of countries where you can basically wander in and start working ( legally ) would be the ideal answer for this : d

algorithms to remove high frequency noise from path tracing <eos> i have been working on my own renderer for a while , and i 'm wondering if there 's any way to remove the monte carlo noise from the rendered image , besides waiting for a long time for it to converge ? the way i found is to blur the image , which is not really helpful , since it reduces the quality/sharpness of the image a lot . and i can achieve the same thing by rendering a small image with more samples , then scaling it up . is there any algorithm designed to deal with noise in the image in path tracing ?

could the gps be used to aid the autopilot with speed ? <eos> in the af447 incident , the autopilot system was offline due to the aircraft 's pitot tubes being obstructed by ice particles . since the physical condition of the plane in air is cold and risky , the same physical obstruction could happen again and again . though the pilot is trained to fly the plane in bad weather , i 'm wondering why not just use the gps to aid the plane 's computer ? the gps system could be a secondary source to providing the computer with information for flying , like speed and altitude . if the gps could 've aided af447 in preventing the autopilot system from going offline , would the pitot 's issue not to initialize the system problem then crash a plane ?
proper way to give metta <eos> is it necessary to only feel subtle sensations while giving metta or is it only required to be equanimous while giving metta . i have sometimes felt painful sensations that can not be 'shaken away ' after a sit and find it harder to concentrate on giving metta . so should one only be equanimous and carry on with the practice or leave metta bhavana to another time ? what works for you while radiating metta ?
bidder count impact on uniform price economics <eos> say we have an uniform price auction where DIGIT really rare stamp is for sale . only DIGIT randomly selected stamp collectors are invited to bid and the stamp ends up selling for DIGIT million dollars . now pretend that auction never happened . if DIGIT randomly selected stamp collectors were invited instead of DIGIT in the previous example ( again , original auction never happened ) , what expected percent increase in revenue should the stamp sell for - DIGIT more , DIGIT more ? similarly , what if only DIGIT bidders were allowed to the auction ? in short , i 'm trying to determine how increasing or decreasing bidder participation by DIGIT impacts the ultimate selling price on a percentage basis . i 'm sure lots of variables are at play , so am not sure if any economic theory can be used to address this .

what is meant by interrupts in the context of operating systems ? <eos> i 've decided to read operating systems concepts by silberschatz , galvin gagne ( 8th edition ) over the summer . i 've gotten to a topic that 's confusing me - interrupts and their role as it relates to operating systems . the text says that an operating system will begin a first process such as `` init '' and then wait for an `` event '' to occur and this event is usually signaled by an interrupt . the text also says that the interrupt can come from either the hardware or the software . how does this work , in a little more detail ? is the operating system driven by interrupts ? i am just looking for some big picture understanding .

what are some alternatives to under gravel filters for a DIGIT gallon pond ? <eos> i 'm considering building a pond in the metro atlanta georgia area . i 've owned a pond before that had an under gravel filter when we moved into the house . the filter was essentially a network of white plastic pipes with holes drilled into them that were hooked to a pump that fed an external veggie filter . i 've read that under gravel filters are not the best solution . are there other alternatives ?
use of kernel density estimate in naive bayes classifier ? <eos> this question is a follow up to my earlier question here and is also related , in intent , to this question . on this wiki page probability density values from an assumed normal distribution for the training set are used to calculate a bayesian posterior rather than actual probability values . however , if a training set is not normally distributed would it be equally as valid to use a density value taken from the kernel density estimate of the training set to calculate a bayesian posterior ? in its intended application this kernel density estimate would be taken from a theoretically ideal empirical data set generated by mc techniques .

how does `` novelty search '' work ? <eos> the author claims that guiding evolution by novelty alone ( without explicit goals ) can solve problems even better than using explicit goals . in other words , using a novelty measure as a fitness function for a genetic algorithm works better than a goal-directed fitness function . how is that possible ?
is marginal rate of substitution a multivariable function ? <eos> suppose i have $ u ( x , y ) $ and a level set of indifference curves . suppose the value of $ u $ along a given curve is $ bar { u } $ . we know $ du = 0 $ . we compute total derivative , rearrange , and now have $ $ frac { dy } { dx } = -frac { u_x } { u_y } $ $ my confusion and question : $ frac { dy } { dx } $ is written as a function of a single variable right ? but when we talk about $ mu $ , we always talk about it as a multivariable function . i thought $ mrs $ was the ordinal utility analog of the cardinal utility $ mu $ . so why is $ mrs $ a single variable function ?

do any systems in space use artificial intelligence yet ? <eos> technology has apparently advanced to the point some states in the untied states are debating ai managed cars . the thought comes to mind that space is relatively less crowded than most streets on earth . an ai system could probably be tested out there with less risk than down here . of course the same argument may be used to test ai systems in the oceans rather than on roads .. apparently on most modern jetliners too in-flight controls are managed by a computer bank . but that 's a different subject ... ai having been proven to be mature enough to handle atleast traffic patterns in a city , the questions that come to mind are - what systems/programs in a mission may be considered for delegation to ai ? is there any move to use ai onboard systems in the space program ?

how is taq polymerase produced ? <eos> i 've seen taq polymerase being marketed as either `` native '' or `` recombinant '' . i understand that the recombinant version is produced by specially modified escherichia coli strains that have the gene for polymerase production spliced in them , but i am wondering about the `` native '' variant . i imagine that thermus aquaticus is rather difficult to culture in a medium ; is it thus true that the archaeans have to be extracted from the springs they came from for producing `` native '' polymerase ?

guvenen et al : earnings <eos> guvenen et al look at earnings shocks over time , and try to argue whether these are compatible with standard career-ladder models with normal shocks . however , their data is no real shocks , it is time differences in labor earnings . we do not know which part of these were expected . what are things to consider if one tries to take into account for the fact that these income changes are - to some extent - expected ex ante ? my first guess would be that since people expect future rise in income , correcting the `` shocks '' for that would mean that the unexpected part of the shocks is to the left of their yearly changes in wage income . that is , there are more shocks downwards than upwards .

how fair is the claim that shuttle boosters diameter is dictated by the railroad gauge ? <eos> there 's a kind of urban legend that space shuttle boosters diameter could be larger only if was not limited because of the limitations imposed by the railroads and those are imposed by the railroad gauge and the latter is claimed to be dictated by how the ancient romans built their roads . the part concerning the roman roads to modern railroads gauge is debunked in the linked to post and also in this document on nasa.gov ( pdf ) , however i do n't find any convincing detailed analysis of how fair the claim about the boosters diameter depending on the railroad gauge is . do the boosters have exactly this diameter because the larger the better and the current one is the largest one that could be afforded with transporting the boosters by railroad ?

what is the precise definition of a `` heywood case '' ? <eos> i had been using the term `` heywood case '' somewhat informally to refer to situations where an online , 'finite response ' iteratively updated estimate of the variance became negative due to numerical precision issues . ( i am using a variant of welford 's method to add data and to remove older data . ) i was under the impression that it applied to any situation where a variance estimate became negative , either due to numerical error or modeling error , but a colleague was confused by my usage of the term . a google search does n't turn up much , other than that it is used in factor analysis , and seems to refer to the consequences of a negative variance estimate . what is the precise definition ? and who was the original heywood ?

why are some babies always fussy and crying while others are always cheerful ? <eos> i have noticed this very often . i have seen babies who are cheerful ever . my brother in law 's daughter has never ( not literally though ) been seen crying/fussy etc . while as my brother 's baby son is always fussy/crying . in hospitals too i have noticed the pattern with the visitors . no , i am not talking about ill babies . i would like to understand what causes such huge temperament differences among babies . one thing more i have noticed is that the fussy babies are usually weak and the ever cheerful babies are mostly healthy . is this related to health ? is this genetic ?
is jack ( in lord of the flies ) actually 'bad ' ? <eos> for me , the real 'evil ' in the lord of the flies was roger . from the beginning the story shows how he has 'revelations ' about how there is no one to stop him bullying and hurting . jack , for me , simply goes mad , and the apparent lack of punishment suggests this . fear , hunger and pride drive jack to savagery , a way to forget all the bad things ( the beast ) and to have the power his pride needs . jack 's new way of life allows roger to unleash the 'badness ' in him . is my interpretation correct ? or did golding mean for roger and jack to be equally 'bad ' and roger simply the more physical one of the two ?
privacy issues with email providers <eos> i am looking for an email provider ( or for a way to do it myself ) that will not divulge my personal information under no circumstances . i found out that getting this information with a order for example , is not that difficult and companies such as google ( gmail ) are required by law to comply . is there a company that will not give my personal information when asked so by a lawyer ? not because they do n't want to ( again , not sure if it 's possible ) but because they delete all the info 's related with my account when the session ends ( e.g . logs , ip address etc. ) . also , what is the best way to approach this matter ? thanks .

what is needed for bitcoin to become the reserve currency of the world ? <eos> bitcoin 's characteristics seem to make it a prime candidate as a reserve currency , given it has fast transactions to anywhere in the world at a low cost with little to no price manipulation or export/import controls . imagine a traveller arriving in a foreign country , having bought DIGIT bitcoins in his country . rather than go through a middle-man currency exchange , he finds someone who wants bitcoins ( or even a bitcoin atm ) and sell his bitcoins for local currency . when he is ready to leave , he simply sells back his local cash for bitcoins without being hit twice by the currency exchange 's transaction fees . what would have to happen to make this a reality ? is it feasible ?
how do visual obstructions impact the ability to localize using lidar ? <eos> if a street is extremely crowded to an extent that the terrain is not visible from the point of view of the lidar ( e.g . in google 's self driving car ) , can it still manage to localize itself and continue to operate ? i recall sebastian thrun saying that google 's car can not navigate through snow filled roads since the onboard lidar can not map the terrain beneath the snow ( e.g . here ) . [ edit : based on the comments ] clarifying the context , here `` not visible '' means there is an obstacle between the lidar and the terrain

reasons for the recent rise in long-term unemployment <eos> kroft et al document the raise of long-term unemployed in the us during the recent crises . this is an impressive figure from their paper : they show that the raise does not come from compositional effects . however , they can not find the reason for this phenomenon . for some reason , apparently , long-term unemployed are less likely to find a job , and hence their stock accumulates . potential reasons i could think of are human capital deterioration discrimination of employers shrinking motivation of searching what other reasons does the literature find ? is there empirical support for any of this ?

does human digestive system benefit from eating same kind of food consistently ? <eos> here 's the reason why i 'm asking : i 've heard that it takes some time for pets ( cats/dogs ) to adjust to a different dry feed , where the new feed has to be mixed with the old one , slowly replacing the old one . i 'm wandering if this advice has any truth in it , and if so , does this apply to humans as well ? for example , a cat eats the same kind of food for months at a time , but humans vary their diet much more dramatically . are there any benefits to eating the same kind of food over extended period of time ? i 'm interested in knowing if the digestive system/symbiotic bacteria in the gut adapts to the food , resulting in better digestion/absorption of nutrients . thank you for your input !

period detection of a generic time series <eos> this post is the continuation of another post related to a generic method for outlier detection in time series . basically , at this point i 'm interested in a robust way to discover the periodicity/seasonality of a generic time series affected by a lot of noise . from a developer point of view , i would like a simple interface such as : unsigned int discover_period ( vector & lt ; double & gt ; v ) ; where v is the array containing the samples , and the return value is the period of the signal . the main point is that , again , i ca n't make any assumption regarding the analyzed signal . i already tried an approach based on the signal autocorrelation ( detecting the peaks of a correlogram ) , but it 's not robust as i would like .

is it ethical to create a chatbot to answer questions on stack overflow ? <eos> i was wondering if i should do this , because DIGIT out of DIGIT questions on stack overflow do n't ever get answered , or if they do get ( an ) answer ( s ) , most of the time they 're not helpful . so i was thinking -- why not create a chat bot to answer stack overflow 's questions & amp ; provide necessary information to the general public ? i mean why not ? i 've always been interested in ai , and all i 'd need to do is create a basic logic database and a context system , pack an artificial personality with ( partial ) human instincts , and bam i 'm done . but then again , would it be ethical ?

utility of displacements potentials in geophysics <eos> in the elasticity theory , you can derive a wave equation from the fundamental equation of motion for an elastic linear homogeneous isotropic medium : $ rho partial^2_t overline { u } = mu nabla^2 overline { u } + ( mu+lambda ) nabla ( nabla cdot overline { u } ) $ but in the seismology tradition , you introduce scalar and vector potentials for the p and s components of the displacements , derive wave equations for them and use them . now , in electrodynamics you can derive from maxwell 's equations the wave equations for fields and for potentials ; but there you use the potentials because they compose a quadrivector . in geophysics what 's the convenience of it ?

what is a substitute/complement in terms of mixed partial derivatives ? <eos> i am trying to understand how substitutability relates to mixed partial derivatives . i thought the change in marginal utility with respect to a change in the amount of $ x $ would correspond to $ $ frac { partial u } { partial x } $ $ so i got confused when i take the partial of that with respect to $ y $ . does this measure the rate mu changes wrt $ x $ as we change $ y $ ? how is that related to being a substitute ?

how to ask someone to pay fees on time <eos> as a tutor i have to ask students to pay their fees . most of them pay the fees but almost at the end of the course . none pay within the first month or so . most students feel urging them to pay their fee is annoying and suggests that my interest is only to make money , rather than teaching them . why do n't people understand and respect the teacher 's point of view also ? people spend money on foolish things -- that 's their choice -- but when it comes to pay someone and they ca n't , that choice becomes careless .
is the claim `` this coin is fair '' falsifiable ? <eos> wikipedia says , the claim `` no human lives forever '' is not falsifiable since one would have to observe a human living forever to falsify that claim . thinking on similar lines , even if the coin is fair , it can produce a arbitrarily long ( finite ) sequence of continuous heads with finite but small probability . so if you were to determine whether a coin is not fair , you will have to toss it to eternity to be sure . the assumption here is that it is not possible to determine the fairness just by looking at the physical properties alone . does falsifiability require the process of falsification be finished in finite time ?

is the function of adjacent genes correlated ? <eos> do genes that occupy a similar locus on the genome have correlated function , specifically in human beings ? it is my understanding that adjacent genes are inherited together , and so location plays a role there . however it terms of function , i do n't know to what extent location plays a role . furthermore , if say two adjacent genes have the same expression , does this necessarily mean that their function is correlated , or is that interpretation stretch ?

dsp : stationary non-periodic signal : what 's the best causal technique ? <eos> this is a bit dsp-related : so if you turn your non-stationary time series into a stationary process , you 'll probably see that it is not periodic.. this is an issue for fourier-based techniques because they are not local in frequency . now , besides wavelets ( some types are causal btw ) , which other causal techniques can you use ? ( and arma is not it ) . i tried empirical mode decomposition ( hht ) , but that 's not causal ; i tried intrinsic time-scale decomposition : not causal either . wavelets are pretty old and i would think something better would have been `` discovered '' by now ? does anyone know of a good causal signal processing technique that deals well with non-periodicity ? thanks ! !

handling hiss at 192k <eos> i like capturing low level sounds at 192k and making them larger than life by down-pitching them via sample rate . one problem i sometimes run into is that the hiss of my preamp is a bit too much because i have it boosted so high , and when it gets down-pitched two octaves , that hiss that was previously around 10k and above is somewhere around 4k and it is very apparent . do any of you have a similar phenomenon when you record and down-pitch sounds from 192k , and what sequence do you noise reduce it ? most of my noise reduction plug-ins do n't work at 192k anyway , so do you drop it to 96k and reduce it there , and then drop it to 48k ? i 'm curious if anyone has run into this before and what you do to handle it .

terms for structural analysis of a non-linear narrative <eos> i 'm struggling to identify established terms for analyzing non-linear narratives . if the narrative chronology is the order in which events are narrated , what is the standard term for the `` internal '' chronology of the fiction itself ? and to which of the two `` chronologies '' should we seek to apply the standard structural patterns like e.g . freytag 's pyramid ? for example , in hamlet , the event that arguably kicks off the whole sordid tale is when claudius murders the king , but the actual narrative starts in media res with the appearance of the king 's ghost . sources disagree on which of the two events is the `` inciting incident '' . non-linear narratives date back millennia , can it really be true that we 're still struggling with the terminology ?

use waste heat of electrical appliances in place of traditional heating ? <eos> does it make sense to keep electrical appliances turned on , or at least not turned off , during the winter as a partial replacement for traditional heating ? i 'm thinking in particular of computers , screens , audio and video equipment and home entertainment systems . seems to me there is no difference between heat from electrical resistance in a wasteful gadget and heat from the same process in a regular space heating system . and if the heating system is fossil-powered , there is presumably a chance that replacing some of it by `` energy inefficiency '' would end up a greener solution . is this reasonable , and if so what factors could determine the calculation ?

when do structural hazards occur in pipelined architectures ? <eos> i 'm looking for some relatively simple examples of when structural hazards occur in a pipelined architecture . the only scenario i can think of is when memory needs to be accessed during different stages of the pipeline ( ie , the initial instruction fetch stage and the later memory read/write stage ) . i 'm thinking that there are many more structural hazards in more complex architectures , such as superscalar . does it class as a structural hazard when an instruction is dispatched to an execution unit but is queued because the unit is in use ? if this is highly architecture-specific , then just assume mips or something similar .

what 's your strategy behind 192khz recording ? <eos> lots of us record at at 192k for the 4x sample rate improvement , but how does that translate to a more useful or flexible sound file ? according to tim prebble , plug-ins are more effective at 192k ( which i 've found to be the case as well ) but because they take longer to render i end up using them less due to time constraints . also , if most microphones are only capturing frequencies up to 20khz , should n't we use `` hi-def '' mics ( 30 - 100khz range ) when recording 192k ? your thoughts are apprciated !

how are low pressure zones tracked across the ocean ? <eos> when you look at a surface pressure chart e.g . : ( from URL you can see low pressure zones over the north atlantic ocean . how are these zones tracked ? i can not imagine there are many monitoring stations in the atlantic ocean . possible ways : ships - but i doubt there are enough to get readings over a wide enough area . comparison of pressure readings from coastal monitoring stations . are there enough points for accurate interpolation of the readings ? aircraft - comparison of gps altitude to barometric pressure readings could give the surface pressure in a given area . that said , most aircraft travelling over the atlantic are on specified tracks which may not cover a given area . monitoring stations on buoys at well spaced locations in the ocean . potentially impractical and a hazard to shipping .
comparative methods of econometric analysis <eos> while rims ii , implan , and other methods regularly deviate substantially from each other in the answers they yield to analytical questions , is there a `` band '' within results should be considered `` more accurate '' . for example , if rims and implan give a quantitative result on the order of x , and a third method gives a result 2,3 , or more orders of magnitude higher , should the third method be disregarded ? i ask this because i 've submitted analysis based off industry-specific methods and had it roundly rejected not because there was a flaw in my analysis , but because it did n't agree with general case tools , or differed to markedly . is there a best practice within econometrics that says `` throw out all results farther than y from some accepted average '' ?

philosophical works addressing the problem of dilution of meaning <eos> as a software developer , i often face the problem of meaningless terms . it is very common in our industry that a certain term is first coined with a very specific and useful meaning . then , it becomes fashionable to use that term , so everyone starts using it to mean more and more things until , in a couple of years , the term has become so diluted that its original meaning is lost altogether . this has been occurring with the term agile , for example . which philosophers have addressed this probem of dilution of meaning and how to avoid it ? i have illustrated the problem with a software development example , but it may occur in every professional field . when a term has reached that meaningless state , it becomes impossible to have a rational , useful and unambiguous discussion .

why do differential forms and integrands have different transformation behaviours under diffeomorphisms ? <eos> let $ f $ be a diffeomorphism , say from $ mathbb r^n $ to $ mathbb r^n $ , such as the transition map between two coordinate charts on a differentiable manifold . a differential $ n $ -form ( or rather its coefficient function which is obtained by using the canonical one-chart atlas on $ mathbb r^n $ ) then transforms essentially by multiplication with $ mathrm { det } ( df ) $ , while integrals transform essentially by multiplication of the integrand with $ lvertmathrm { det } ( df ) rvert $ . ( this is the reason for the necessity to choose an orientation in order to define the integral of a top form on a differentiable manifold . ) question : what is an intuitive or conceptional reason for these different transformation behaviours of forms and integrands ?

are there any useful formal propositional logics without any inference rules ? <eos> propositional systems have axioms and inference rules . they bifurcate into two types , hilbert-style where the number of inference rules are minimised ; and natural deduction where the number of axioms are minimsed . in fact it is possible to have natural deduction systems that have no axioms , i 'm not sure if this is in fact the usual ones looked at . in general hilbert-style systems usually have just one inference rule : modus ponens . obviously it is possible to have a hilbert-style formal system with no inference rules , the question is whether they are useful in anyway ? ( perhaps if we consider the category of all hilbert-style formal systems they need to be included to get good formal properties for the category ? )

model suggestion <eos> could anyone give me hints as to a model framework that can be used in the following setting : the outcome a is dichotomous . i want to investigate the effect of a continuous variable b and a continous variable c on a in a longitudinal setting . so far so good . the problem is that c depends on b , in that values of b above a threshold ( unfortunately we do not know the threshold and the threshold itself might not be constant over time ) will change c. the change in c will furthermore reduce b in the next measurement . how can i decipher the isolated effect og b and c on a ? would a mixed-logistic-regression model be ok ? ie ; t=time a~b*t+c*t+b*c*t any other ideas ? //m

how do i encourage people to automate frequent tasks ? <eos> we often find in our consulting practice that automation can have a huge impact on personal productivity when using computers . these could be as simple as text replacement or as complicated as a sequence of multiple steps that make contextual decisions . the challenge seems to be that most people do n't understand the concept of automation until they see it , and then most people do n't really take to it until they have it implemented on their own system . even then , many workers do not seem to remember to use those or ever implement their own . any thoughts or perspectives on this ?

why decommission the iss ? <eos> what concerns , besides orbit decay and continued cost of operation ( and potentially , a critical failure ) are the motivations behind decommissioning the iss by 2020 ? i mean , i 'm fairly sure it would be cheaper to develop a weak-thrust motor that would move the station to a higher orbit , instead of just dumping it and building a new one , and it 's probably quite some time before it begins failing as badly as mir would while still operating .

finding groups with given automorphism <eos> familiar exercise : suppose $ g $ is a finite group and $ t $ is an automorphism of $ g $ which sends more than three quarters of elements of $ g $ onto their inverses , then prove that $ g $ is abelian . the group of quarternions is an example of a group which sends exactly $ displaystyle frac { 3 } { 4 } $ elements onto their inverses . is there a finite group with an automorphism $ t $ which sends exactly $ displaystylefrac { 4 } { 5 } $ of elements of $ g $ onto their inverses ? similarly can we find groups with automorphism $ t $ which sends exactly $ displaystyle frac { n } { n+1 } $ of elements of $ g $ onto their inverses .
what is kant ’ s strategy to overcome humean skepticism without having recourse to the metaphysical excesses of rationalism ? <eos> i understand that by metaphysical excesses , he meant supernatural entities , such as god , or the soul , to explain things in the phenomenal world . also , to my understanding , hume 's skepticism boils down to his belief that one can never find the effect in the cause ( in contrast to descartes , who followed the imprint theory of causation ) . but the question above ? i do n't know what kant 's strategy is . thanks for the help in advance .

vectorizing half tone images <eos> vectorizing continuous tone images is often met with color palette reduction and visual artifacts . half-tone images , on the hand , have constant patterns in their tones , which would intuitively lead to the conclusion that these images can be vectorized with greater success , if without any visual artifacts at all . failing to find any sufficient comparisons against vectorizing continuous tone images and half-tone images on separate research , i now pose this : what behaviors occur during vectorization of `` raster '' half-tone images ?

was plato using strawmen in his dialogues ? <eos> in plato 's dialogues , he often would put words into the mouths of two opposing points-of-view , while inserting a third voice , often initially presented as taking a position between the two viewpoints , to act as an arbiter to decide the merits of the two views .

how do i motivate my colleagues ? <eos> sometimes i have to work with a particular colleague on my team ; the problem is , in my opinion , that he takes his work too lightly . when i start a job , i commit to it and want to meet my deadlines and provide a decent product ( i 'm a programmer ) . my colleague just wants to make it work , but does n't think about maintainability , documentation , etc . i feel like his attitude might affect our project and is the basis for some frustration . how do i motivate him ? how do i bring up that i do n't like the way we are working at the moment ?

in what ways do gmos harm or benefit the environment ? <eos> in principle , does the manner in which genetic engineering is currently used in agriculture pose a threat to our environment , or provide benefits ? i understand there are concerns about reduction of genetic diversity , but are there more specific concerns ? can such concerns be outweighed by reduced need for pesticides and fertilizers that gmos promise ? could increased yields reduce impact on the planet by slowing rates of deforestation ? are there models which predict interaction between gmo use , yields , chemical use , etc ?

what is the optimal frame size for protein secondary structure prediction methods ? <eos> the whole question is what is the optimal frame size for the second and third generation protein secondary structure prediction methods ? justify your answer . i remember it has something to do with the average length of alpha-helix . more specifically , DIGIT on both side of a site . so in total the frame length should be DIGIT but i ca n't remember the reason behind the argument . what do you think ? according to what my professor said in class , 2nd and 3rd generation of protein secondary structure reconstruction relies on statistics data of several consecutive residues . i guess what he meant by `` frame size '' , is how many adjacent residues we should take into account in the algorithm .
solution to allow javascript input but prevent xss <eos> we have a simple blog system that allows users to input html and javascript to build a blog page . i 'm aware that allowing javascript open up the door to xss attacks . we do however need to allow users to insert javascript , as an exmple would be allowing the user to insert a google ads code which contains javascript . the question is how go about allowing javascript while preventing xss . i was assuming https would secure cookies and prevent cookie stealing , but users on stackoverflow said otherwise .
how does the core relate to strong equilibrium ? <eos> an allocation is in the core if there 's no coalition that blocks it . a strong equilibrium ( aumann , 1959 ) is a nash equilibrium in which no coalition , taking the actions of its complements as given , can cooperatively deviate in a way that benefits all members of the coalition . how are these distinct ? i usually do n't think of the core as a solution concept , but i 'm struggling to disentangle it from strong equilibrium .

why was the book animal farm banned in non-communist countries ? <eos> i understand why it was banned in the ussr , because it 's pretty blatant satire of the ussr . it 's also still banned in north korea for the same reason . but why was it banned in the united arab emirates and kenya and censored in vietnam ? it was also briefly banned from DIGIT by the allies of wwii , but i 'm fairly certain that 's due to the governments of the allies not wanting anti-russian ( another partner in the allies ) sentiments .

why do firms bother to produce at equilibrium quantities if at equilibrium quantity , mr < mc ? <eos> for almost all demand curves , the resulting marginal revenue curve is often to the left of and steeper than the demand curve . the marginal cost curve has its distinctive u-shape , and a particular portion of the marginal cost curve is the supply curve . so the result can be shown below : the figure above indicates that in almost any case , because mr is to the left of d , if a firm produces the quantity at market equilibrium , mr & lt ; mc , which means that the firm would be actively losing profits . so , why do firms even bother going to market equilibrium - from a theoretical standpoint ?
intensity of pixel area light in reflective shadow map ? <eos> in reflective shadow map , there is definition about intensity of pixel area light : $ $ i_p ( omega ) = phi_p max { 0 , langle n_p | omega rangle } $ $ where $ langle | rangle $ is the dot product , $ phi_p $ is the reflected radiant flux . so , an integral of intensity over himisphere is $ $ phi_p = int_omega i_p mathrm d omega = int_omega phi_p max { 0 , langle n_p | omega rangle } mathrm d omega = phi_p pi $ $ which leads to $ phi_p = phi_p pi $ ? anything wrong with my deduction ? here 's a link to the paper . ps . a downloadable link

how far into a speculative novel should one go before introducing the central conflict ? <eos> by speculative , i mean mostly science fiction , fantasy or intrigue . for example neal stephenson 's anathem , which is a 900-page book , goes well past the 200-page mark before the central conflict begins to take form . works such as these have universes that need to be explained to the reader before the story proper can begin , but does this sort of thing cause the reader to lose interest ? more specifically , in my case , if the villain is still hidden DIGIT pages into a 300-page book , will it bore the reader ? note that there may be many small incidents and disasters , and other characters may be searching for answers , but the overarching conflict is toward the middle of the book .

why does light refract if photons are not bound by an axle ? <eos> in the classic metaphor , a light beam bends for the same reason that a wagon getting one wheel stuck in the sand does ... the wheels travel at uneven speeds , and the wheel on the smoother surface travels faster . but the key to the wagon scenario is the axle - if the two wheels were not bound , the faster wheel would sail on , heedless of the other wheel 's difficulty . so , if the metaphor is useful at all , there is an axle force binding the photos in a beam of light , which causes it to turn when it hits a different medium non-perpendicularly . or is this just a bad metaphor for the rubes ?

when did songs extolling leaders of companies go out of fashion ? <eos> when recently visiting computer history museum in mountain view , ca i came across an exhibit called `` songs of the ibm '' . it 's from 1930s and has a song called `` ever onward '' which extols then ibm president t.j watson . it was regularly sung by ibmers . this seemed very strange to me because the only current leader i can think of having songs extolling his virtues would be `` dear leader '' from north korea . so my questions are : was it common in the beginning of 20th century for companies/organizations to have songs extolling their leaders ? if yes , when did this go out of fashion and why ?

when did commercial speech recognition first begin using grammar ( sentence structure ) for prediction ? <eos> it seems as though modern speech recognition ( e.g. , through android , ios phones ) make use of grammar or sentence structure .

pros and cons of cartesian vs. z-matrix representations of molecules ? <eos> over the course of my studies , i have switched largely from using z-matrix representations of molecular geometries in calculations to cartesian representations . the software that i use now makes it easy to add the sorts of constraints/restraints/transits that i would have previously used z-matrices for , and i know that z-matrix geometries can be problematic in large molecules* where minute changes in a bond angle or dihedral ( due , for instance , to rounding errors/low-quality gradients ) can result in large movements in peripheral atoms . what pros or cons exist for either geometry definition that i do n't know about ? what circumstances recommend one representation over another ? *or small molecules with silly z-matrices .

to what extent did native american cultures develop metalworking for tools and weapons ? <eos> when europeans started showing up in the new world , the native cultures were technologically far behind . many still used stone tools : north american tribes used flint , while some mesoamerican cultures used obsidian . andean and other civilizations worked precious metals for decorative purposes . i was made aware in the comments that some cultures had indeed adopted bronze working , or even used meteoric iron . but on the whole , the use of hard metals like bronze and iron does n't appear to have been nearly as widespread as in the old world , despite many parts of the americas having rich metal deposits . so my question is , which cultures did make extensive use of metals for producing tools and weapons , and why did metalworking technology not become as prevalent in pre-colombian america as it did across eurasia ?

how should i dampen timpani ? <eos> i 've been working on my timpani playing , and the music has it written in that i should dampen certain notes at various parts of the song . but having i 'm having trouble figure out the best technique for doing so . when i put my hand flat on the timpani head it makes a buzzing sound and the sound continue for a while afterwards . if i press harder , the resonance stops slightly more quickly , but the notes goes sharp because of the added tension on the head . how can i learn to dampen timpani quickly , but with minimal 'ring over ' , sharpness of note , and buzzing sound from my hand touching the drum ?

does anonymous have a coherent ideology ? <eos> the direct action group anonymous has gained a great deal of attention in recent years as a result of its various `` ops '' , usually targeted against governments and large corporations . however , because of its deliberately amorphous nature , claimed lack of leaders , etc. , i find it difficult to get a clear grasp of its overall aims . has any serious analysis been done of the ( perhaps emergent ) ideology of anonymous ? can it reasonably be described as anarchist , anti-capitalist or something else ? is it even reasonable to call it a political movement in the first place ?
looking for a ranking algorithm that favors newer entries <eos> i 'm working on a ranking system that will rank entries based on votes that have been cast over a period of time . i 'm looking for an algorithm that will calculate a score which is kinda like an average , however i would like it to favor newer scores over older ones . i was thinking of something along the line of : $ $ frac { mathrm { score } _1 + 2cdot mathrm { score } _2 + dots + ncdot mathrm { score } _n } { 1 + DIGIT + dots + n } $ $ i was wondering if there were other algorithms which are usually used for situations like this and if so , could you please explain them ?
how can i increase the cfm of my ceiling fan ? <eos> since i am unable to change the pitch of the blades on my ceiling fan , i am considering buying a larger one . the current one is certainly efficient enough as that is why i bought it in the first place ( cfm/watt ) ; however , i need more airflow . altering the pitch would have been ideal but that is not an option . this ceiling fan has hidden blade connections . how can i modify the fan blades to increase the airflow produced by the fan ? for example , does the idea of winglets have merit ? what would be the effect of winglets on a ceiling fan vs an airfoil ? or , would notching the trailing edge as suggested in this answer help increase airflow ?
the assault weapon ban recently expired in the usa , what did it ban ? <eos> the federal assault weapon ban wikipedia page notes that it banned cosmetic features that make a gun look like a fully automatic rifle , that it only banned DIGIT such weapons , and those weapons manufactures quickly found ways around the law . the DIGIT law in theory banned ak-47s , mac-10s , uzis , ar-15s and other 'assault weapons ' . yet the gun industry easily found ways around the law and most of these weapons are now sold in post-ban models virtually identical to the guns congress sought to ban in DIGIT -what constitutes an assault weapon ? -which guns were banned , and how did their post-ban models differ ?
how well does capm beta track the risk of a particular market relative to world markets ? <eos> can the capm beta of emerging markets be less than the beta of the developed markets ? as part of my research , i run regressions using market indices . i estimate the beta using a regression of msci country/region excess returns on the excess returns of the msci acwi . excess returns are returns minus the risk-free rate ( which i take to be the t-bill rate ) . when running this regression , i found the following strange result . while the beta of china is less than 1 , the beta of the usa and of europe are greater than DIGIT can anyone please explain this result ?
a general question about pid controller <eos> i have a basic question because i 'm trying to understand right now a concept that i thought it was obvious . looking at this video he is going to feedback the variable state x with the input of the system , which is a force f. now , if i 'm correct it is only possibile to feedback variables which share the same units , so i expect to drive a meter through an input variable which is a meter and the difference will be then feed into the pid . is the example in the video just to show up how to use simulink ? or i m wrong ?
why should almost extinct animals be protected from going extinct ? <eos> the feeling that it 's `` sad '' if a species dies out seems to be coming from an aesthetic point of view how the world should be . but is there a rationality behind it ? the only rational reason i was able to come up with is that more variety gives more possibilities for study . but this is only a weak argument i think and i hardly believe that this is the reason why most people would like to see these almost extinct animals protected . and i do n't even talk about killings here , or animals in physical pain . take , for example , george , who died a few weeks ago . it makes me feel that people do n't like these creatures to die because they do n't want to die alone when they 're old .

what amendment to the u.s. constitution removed the provision for slaves to count as three fifths of a person ? <eos> one of the compromises in the original u.s. constitution provided that slaves counted as three fifths of a person for the purposes of computing populations and thus allocating seats to the house of representatives . where exactly does this provision fall in the constitution and what amendment to the constitution eliminates this or does it remain but no longer apply since there are no more slaves ? how was the number 3/5ths arrived at , did it somehow provide population parity between the free and slave states ?
how are airspace violations detected ? <eos> are airspace violations ( e.g . entry to class b without clearance ) based on primary radar and/or mode c transponder , or something else ? i read that mode c altitude is based on pressure altitude , i.e. , set to 29.92 '' ... but presumably that 's adjusted at the atc facility based on the current pressure before being used for altitude enforcement . this begs the question , what would stop one ( hypothetically ) , just winding back the altimeter pressure reading to appear to be at a lower altitude ? so to summarize : how are airspace violations detected : what data input is used ? if mode c reading is used , is it based on pilot 's altimeter ? would winding back the altimeter make a plane report a lower altitude ?
is a vertical , soil vegetable garden a bad idea ? <eos> so my mom has all this junk wood she 's been collecting , and i think i found a good use for it : as above-ground planters or as a vertical planter `` post '' ( say DIGIT x DIGIT x DIGIT feet ) . basically , fill it with soil and have planters coming off the sides . would i some how need to compensate for gravity and more water accumulating on the lower plant roots ? would this attract termites if i did n't use redwood ( or cedar ) but emptied it every year ?

how did italian manage to stay ( mostly ) phonetically spelled despite its long written tradition ? <eos> italian is commonly cited as an example of a phonetically spelled language . it is easy to guess how an italian word is pronounced based on the way it is written , because each written symbol highly corresponds to a sound ( with some exceptions ) . this is not the case with english and french , for example . series of sound changes ( for example , the great vowel shift ) caused changes in pronunciations and the written form did n't catch up . why did n't the same thing happen to italian ? it is an old language , and the latin alphabet has been used since before the language existed . did sound changes not happen ? or did they happen but the written form caught up ? or are the changes so systematic that the letter-sound correspondence still holds ?
must basis of an euclidean space be ordered <eos> does the basis of an euclidean space have to be ordered by definition ? or can be left unordered ? i was also wondering about what is the morphism ( i.e . the mapping that can preserve all the structures ) on euclidean spaces ? is it euclidean transformation ( rigid transformation ) , consisting of rotation , translation and reflection ? or the reflection is not part of it , because the basis of a euclidean space must be ordered . thanks and regards !

wizard 's appearances in the wonderful wizard of oz <eos> it 's been a long time since i read the book the wonderful wizard of oz , but wikipedia confirms my memory of events . when the four protagonists appear individually before the wizard , he has a different appearance for each of them : the scarecrow sees a beautiful woman the tin woodsman sees a monster the cowardly lion sees a ball of fire but these are all jumbled . it was the scarecrow who was afraid of fire , the woodsman who could not love , and the lion who was afraid of monsters . was there a purpose to this ? was it meant to imply that the wizard was an idiot ? some other symbolism that i just did n't see ?

are truth-claims inappropriate ? <eos> strictly speaking , is it inappropriate to make a truth-claim ? i am seeking an answer from philosophy ( epistemology ) , and feel free to use logic i am speaking `` theoretically '' , not `` practically '' i am defining `` truth '' as `` an objective truth '' ( e.g . `` there is a car in my driveway '' ) i am excluding divine revelation ( miraculous `` acts of god '' which supernaturally enable you to know that which would otherwise be impossible to know ) in other words , is it more appropriate to say `` i think there is a car in my driveway '' , as opposed to `` there is a car in my driveway '' ?

does the amount of the transaction fee affect the priority of a transaction ? <eos> i 've been reading about transaction fees here . from the aritcle , transaction priority is calculated as a value-weighted sum of input age , divided by transaction size in bytes : priority = sum ( input_value_in_base_units * input_age ) /size_in_bytes transactions need to have a priority above 57,600,000 to avoid the enforced limit ( as of client version 0.3.21 ) . there are rules for determining the transaction fees needed depending on client etc . my question is does paying a fee increase the priority or else how does it increase the chances that the transaction will be accepted by the network . if it changes the priority , what is the formula for determining priority . if you pay more than the default fee does it increase the priority even more ?
what does pudd'nhead wilson 's joke about half a dog mean ? <eos> in pudd'nhead wilson , by mark twain , the character david wilson makes a remark that results in the townspeople writing him off as a `` pudd'nhead '' . he had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable , whereupon young wilson said , much as one who is thinking aloud -- `` i wish i owned half of that dog .

does the language of regular expressions need a push down automata to parse it ? <eos> i want to convert a user entered regular expression into an nfa so that i can then run the nfa against a string for matching purposes . what is the minimum machine that can be used to parse regular expresssions ? i assume it must be a push down automaton because the presense of brackets means the need to count and a dfa/nfa can not perform arbitrary counting . is this assumption correct ? for example , the expression a ( bc* ) d would require a pda so that the sub-expression in brackets is handled correctly .
what are the differences between paleo and atkins diets ? <eos> i have been slowly adopting a paleo diet over the past few by changing what i eat for breakfast and incorporating more protein and vegetables . in addition , i have also been making changes in what i eat for dinner as well . since i 'm eating more meat and vegetables and less grains , it struck me that this sounds much like the atkins diet which eliminates carbs . i am okay with the diet no matter what you call it , but the terminology confuses me . what are the main differences between a paleo diet and an atkins one ?
capabilities of bitcoins and their place in the future <eos> i ` ve recently read a presentation that mentioned a couple things about how big would be the potential bandwidth if bitcoins would handle the transaction volume of visa : URL it stated , that storing all visa transactions would take about 1tb of storage per week . this certainly limits the feasibility of using the bitcoin protocol as an alternative to existing payment processors . are there any plausible concepts of what part of the economy bitcoins might be capable of replacing entirely , and which would be harder or impossible to substitute with 'coins ?

what is the chemistry behind this `` petrol from air '' technology ? <eos> a recent news report in the uk claimed a breakthrough in making a petrol equivalent from carbon dioxide and water : a small british company has produced the first `` petrol from air '' using a revolutionary technology that promises to solve the energy crisis as well as helping to curb global warming by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere . it sounds like the news reports are over-hyping it a little ( and i 'm not sure it is that new ) , so what is the real chemistry behind it ? what are the key reactions and how much input energy is required ?
is the coast of england a platonic form ? <eos> a real-world circle is not a true circle which , as far as platos concerned , lives in the world of forms . but is n't a fractal a mathematical form , so that does live in the the world of forms ; and as mandelbrot pointed out , the coast of england , the shape of a cloud and the shape of a fern are fractals so they too live in the world of forms ? going further , is n't the standard model when expressed geometrically a form so that too lives there , and its consequences are too , so the universe itself is in the world of forms ; does n't this then involve a infinite regress ?

exercising an american call option early <eos> i have seen the rationale behind why it is never optimal to exercise an american call option early , but have a question about it . if the option strike price is $ e= $ 20 $ and it expires at $ t=1yr $ , if the share price is $ s= $ 25 $ at expiry , the profit will be $ $ 5 $ per share . however , what if at $ t=0.5yr $ the share price was $ s= $ 40 $ following a jump in the price . exercising at this point would yield a profit of $ $ 20 $ per share . would it not be more optimal to exercise early , in this case ?

what is the process for purifying koh ? <eos> i 'm partnered with a jewelry production company whose plating baths require $ ce { koh } $ . we 're located in indonesia , where import fees are absurdly high , and reliable suppliers are rare . a local shop sells $ ce { koh } $ at $ 5/kg , but whatever impurities are present in their mix cause enough problems to spoil the entire bath . ( expensive mistake when doing gold plating . ) the only alternative we can find is a merck redistributor , who sells $ ce { koh } $ at close to $ 100/kg , which is ridiculous . is there a relatively simple process we could learn ( of the diy variety ) for removing impurities , turning non-lab-grade $ ce { koh } $ into lab-grade $ ce { koh } $ ?
is it possible to run an `` all remote worker '' company ? <eos> this is mainly for a tech startup , but : as you begun hiring employees , if you did n't want to have to acquire a building and all of that , could you hire all of your employees remotely ? the general idea would be to interview them over skype ( or some similar service ) , and then send them the tools they would need ( macbook pro ) , synchronize with them by using cloud services ( google docs , campfire , github , etc . ) , possibly fly them down to one or two conferences a year ( paid for by the company ) and meet up there in addition to online meetings . what might be some pros and cons of such an approach ? are there any specific things that ought to be watched out for ?

fan sensors ( tachometer vs locked rotor ) <eos> with regard to fan sensors , there are two very common methods for detecting whether the fan is doing what it 's supposed to or not . locked rotor- detects when the fan is working , or when it has stopped . ( on or off voltage signal ) tachometer- detects the speed of the fan , to determine whether it is performing optimally . ( pulsed voltage signals ) my question : q- what is the difference between using these two types of fan sensors in 'some ' design ? additional info : i do n't know what this 'design ' is , but i 'm asking for the practical differences if i picked either one . i understand that both setups use different voltage signals , and require different circuitry to operate . that is beyond what i think would be the practical scope of this question .
what stability issues plague long artificial gravity cylinders ? <eos> the kalpana one presents itself as a practical modern design for a space station with artificial gravity . one of the tweaks that it made was to limit the length to diameter ratio . this leaves it looking somewhat stubby compared to the old o'neil cylinder type or other fictional stations . their justification : the radius is the minimum necessary to provide 1g at the hull when rotating at no more than 2rpm . the length is the longest possible while ensuring rotational stability . i do n't expect that this would absolutely rule out the slender designs forever , but there is some concern about disturbances that longer stations would be subject to , and i ca n't quite understand what . you 'll have some wobble control either way , but what is it exactly that would make longer designs more challenging to manage ?
initial writing medium <eos> i am curious which is better for a beginning writer ( or writer ) starting a new story . pen and paper or the computer ? pen & amp ; paper is a lot more sketchy ( like the layout of this site ) which gives the feeling of a prototype and may allow ideas to flow better . ideas are jotted down as they come and can be refined at a later date . using a word processor on the other hand is neater and can make text look polished when it is not or make the writer feel the need to polish something before its sufficiently fleshed out .

examples of convergent evolution ? <eos> as an english-speaking student of yiddish , i was pleasantly surprised to discover that the indefinite article was an before vowels and a before consonants , just like in english . but as far as i can tell , yiddish developed this independently from english . that is , both turned the proto-german *ainaz ( `` one '' ) into two separate words , the number one ( eyn in yiddish ) and an indefinite article which is identical in the two languages . are there any other examples of two languages which shared a root , separated , and ended up with nearly identical words much later , despite otherwise diverging considerably ?

does the united states have a built-in mechanism to resolve loss of supply ? and if not , why not ? <eos> in countries that have inherited the westminster system , loss of supply typically results in government being required to either reform as the majority that blocked supply ; or dissolve parliament so the electorate can pass judgement and presumably break the deadlock . as far as i can tell , the united states does n't have an exact equivalent . so my question is : does the united states have a built-in mechanism to resolve loss of supply ? and if not , why not ?

what is the most stable configuration for a centrifugal ship towed by a solar sail ? <eos> solar sails are not fast and acceleration is not going to provide meaningful simulated gravity . for a long journey , spinning a ship to provided simulated gravity can provide health benefits . essentially the ship and sail configuration is a large weight ( ship ) , hanging under a parachute . except that in this case the parachute ( solar sail ) is providing lift away from the sun . keeping the system stable will be important ; to conserve expendable fuel/energy , maximize thrust from the sail , and maintain the general welfare ( homeostasis ) of the mission . what configuration of ship and sail provides the most stability , where the ship is providing 1g of centrifugal force at it 's outer most deck ?

hypothetical long-term business cycle <eos> i was looking through my textbook on money , banking , and the economy and i came to the chart of the hypothetical short-term business cycle deviating around an upward sloping long-term cycle trend . my quarrel with this is does there necessarily have to be an upward sloping long-term trend ? i 'm pondering that if we were to look at economies from different times ( that are isolated in our analysis ) could n't there exist a possibility that in the more grandiose long-term an economy may exhibit flat , or perhaps negative long-term trends . perhaps nations that are on the decline may exhibit these traits . just a random question that i wanted to throw out there .

can we create a DIGIT unit conscious agent ? <eos> suppose we create two units ( or programs ) which run in parallel and we label them as a cognitive unit and the conscious cognitive unit . a human has two units analogously . a rational analyzer and not so rational analyzer .

solar energy without the sun : super led light on top of solar panels ? <eos> some questions : can led light provide same amount of energy as sunlight ? can humanity get rid of the sun and charge solar panels from led light alone ? if this is feasible , this would be truly sustainable energy . have two panels of the same size , bottom one made of solar panel and the top panel made up led light . two panels facing each other . as the led light panel provide light source , the solar panel produces energy to make the led light shine , the excess energy the led bulbs does n't need can be immediately consumed or stored in a battery . this idea would be ideal for places that can not reached by sunlight , like underground parking spaces and during evening hours .

is materialism actually material ? <eos> physicalism allows for forces such as gravity which on the face of it are not material as say the cup of tea i have to hand . so materialism literally taken seems to be wrong . but looking at this more closely ( and taking physicalism to be correct ) the cup is not material either - the reason why the cup does n't fall through the table is due to electromagnetic forces . hence materialism seems to vanish altogether ! ( the sep however does allow a more expansive definition of materialism which is more or less synonymous with physicalism )

why did n't yoda and obi-wan kill darth vader and the emperor ? why wait for skywalker ? <eos> given their fighting skills in the prequels , it seems odd that yoda and obi-wan kenobi should decide to wait for the skywalker kids to grow up . shortly after the episode iii , it seems like they could have dispatched vader and the emperor all by themselves . obi-wan had better lightsaber skills than anakin , so surely he could best darth vader . yoda fought palpatine to a stalemate previously , perhaps with obi-wan 's help he could win . instead , they waited decades for luke and leia to grow up , while millions suffered under the heel of the empire . why not attack earlier than that ?

what was the physical effect on captain picard of borg assimilation ? <eos> after his borg assimilation , captain picard appeared to be DIGIT restored to his original human self . but was that the case ? ( this question is purely about his physical restoration , i 'm not interested here in e.g . any psychological damage ) . specifically , i 'd like to know : did the borg ( eeeek ) remove any of picard 's body ? was picard left with any borg implants ? i remember him ( after being restored to human ) being recognized by a borg as one of them . and i seem to remember him still being able to hear their voices , but ca n't be sure of that .
which is more sustainable : paper bags or ldpe bags ? <eos> at the grocery store , many offer a choice between brown paper bags ( often doubled ) or low density poly-ethylene ( ldpe ) plastic bags . if you plan to recycle in either case , which solution is more sustainable ? alternatively , is buying a reusable heavy duty plastic coated bag better than these disposable choices , or how about a reusable canvas bag ? another option ( only seen this at food co-ops ) is reusing the boxes that the store received to package the goods coming in . if you had to prioritize all these choices , is there a clear ranking and ordering among them ?
how it happened that evolution of `` mater '' and `` pater '' is different despite their similar origin ? <eos> with an addition of pie relatives suffix *-ter- , eurasiatic *ama , *apa became old pie *mā-ter-s , *pa-ter-s ( the final -s was later lost in late pie ) but there is a difference : in old pie *māters the `` a '' is a long vowel while in *paters it is short ( and laryngalists even reconstruct *ph2ters ) . so the question is how the two similar roots gave different vowels in pie and how the laryngealists are able to explain the conversion of a eurasiatic vowel into a laryngeal ?

why do atm call options have a delta of slightly bigger than DIGIT and not DIGIT exactly ? <eos> from the formula of the delta of a call option , i.e . $ n ( d1 ) $ , where $ d_1 = frac { mathrm { ln } frac { s ( t ) } { k } + ( r + 0.5sigma^2 ) ( t-t ) } { sigmasqrt { t-t } } $ , the delta of an atm spot call option is slightly bigger than DIGIT however , this is unintuitive to me ... can anyone explain why ? also , is there any way to interpret what does $ d_1 $ , and $ d_2 $ represent where $ d_1 $ is shown above and $ d_2 = d_1 - sigma ( t-t ) $
minority report - how was precrime supposed to go national ? <eos> in the movie minority report , there is a lot of build up to the nation wide release of precrime . but in the movie the precogs only have a range that entends to the greater d.c. area . and the seemingly retired doctor which accidentally created them did n't seem like the type to make any more . the precogs clearly have some range , because at the end of the movie they are placed on a distant island far away from people . ( i know there is some speculation that the ending is a dream ) . if we are to believe that the precogs see all murders everywhere , it would be a never ending stream of murders . how would they isolate murders in d.c. compared to everywhere else ?
can an upper endoscopy spot gallbladder problems ? <eos> something of a followup to a previous question i asked : is an upper endoscopy ( esophagogastroduodenoscopy or egd ) able to spot gallbladder problems ? i have not really found a consistent answer in a few sources i looked at : musc health : upper endoscopy ( egd ) makes no mention of gallbladder what is eus ? says an eus , endoscopic ultrasound , is needed asge suggests that a specialized endoscopy ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) ) might work ( but that seems more complex than an egd ) however , an upper endoscopy does take a peek at the duodenum . would there be signs of gallbladder problems there , or not ?

formed company in uk as non-resident , having troubles to open a bank account <eos> i have decided to form my start-up in uk , because it was less troublesome , cheaper and faster then the country i live in europe . there were also lots of advertisements to start your business in uk . however , i am facing difficulties to open a bank account in uk , because i am not-resident . i need to open an account in uk , not in my country , because payment processors like paypal or authorize.net asks it . what is the point of forming offshore company in this case ? do you have any experience or solution to this problem ? thanks .
why do companies list jobs on other sites but not on their own site ? <eos> sometimes i run across jobs on monster and other similar sites that look really good , and they 're listed for companies that are good companies that i 'm familiar with . however , when i go to the company website and look through their careers pages , the job does n't seem to exist and is n't listed anywhere on their pages . sometimes these jobs are posted just today , a day ago , or up to a couple weeks ago . it seems very strange that a company would list a job opportunity on a site like monster but have no trace of that opportunity on their very own careers page . is this a common practice , or should i be wary of listings such as these ? what reasons would a company have to list a job opportunity this way ?

is it possible to create minimal gltf files with vertex and index buffers ? <eos> i am currently looking into gltf to use as a transfer format for my webgl project . i already have the geometries i wish to render on my webgl client available as preprocessed vertex and index buffers ( and color buffers , but let 's ignore them for now ) . for example : [ // vertex buffer 0,0,0 , 0,1,0 , 1,0,0 , 1,1,0 , ] and to draw simple lines : [ // index buffer 0,2 , 2,4 , 4,0 , 0,1 , 1,4 , ] i wonder how to create gltf files containing these buffers ? is this possible ? i want to avoid using collada and collada2gltf as this would only add an additional step and might just bloat the resulting gltf files .

how can we introduce some formula for our baby ? <eos> i have always given our baby a bottle of expressed breast milk in the mornings . recently my partner has decided that she is pretty fed up of expressing ( i do n't blame her ! ) and since we are now weaning our baby we figured it would be ok to start giving her some formula . she was quite happy with the formula for a couple of weeks and then suddenly decided she did n't like it . now every time i try to give her a bottle she just struggles and refuses to drink the milk . is there anything i can do to encourage her to take the bottle again ? i am quite a snob and insist that she has only organic produce , which does limit us to a single brand , so changing the brand is not an option ...
what data are used to do these 3d asteroid renderings ? <eos> the number of asteroids that have been directly photographed is very limited , because the probes that do so are very large budget and public . that 's why it 's surprising to see images like this of amun : please correct me if i 'm wrong ( because this is important ) , but i believe the original source for this is the celestia motherlode : URL photography of this object is not possible with any existing telescope . the 3d model has a great deal of intentionality to it , so i do n't think it is just made up , epically after looking at the rest of their library . this claims to be the product of the celestia simulator . but what does this do ? is there radio astronomy data that goes into such renderings ? what are these illustrations showing ?
should you list a desired position title in your resume ? <eos> back in the day i was told that you should always list the title of the position you 're applying for , in your resume . however , some companies only accept resumes you upload to their websites , and they restrict the number of resumes you can upload to their websites to something like 2 , maybe DIGIT resumes at most . so i 'm wondering if it 's still a good idea to list something like `` seeking a senior software engineer '' position in one 's resume . i think it would be better to put that into the cover letter instead . bottom line , in today 's job market , when applying for a job , is it still best practice to list a job title ? or would it be better to state that in a cover letter ?

how does timeseal work ? <eos> i know the the fics ( free internet chess server : URL does use a program called timeseal to measure the time that a user needed to take a move . this timeseal is some time measurement on the client . measuring on the client is much better and fairer than measuring the time on the server since you do n't lose time just by having a bad connection . but since fics has a lot of interfaces to play on - what prevents rogue interfaces to say that they always only used DIGIT seconds for any move ? does anyone know how this is handled ? just a sidenote : i do n't want to build a rogue interface , but i 'm trying to build something similar that is measuing client side time but should not be easy to cheat on .
as-lm model and derivation of the lm curve <eos> when we derive the lm curve , we assume that supply of money is exogenous . however , let 's say the central bank has some target interest , r1 , and it adjust supply of money to keep interest rates equals to r1 with this assumption , what is the slope of the lm curve ? i think it will be horizontal because supply of money is horizontal . what is the slope of the ad curve ? i think it will be vertical because there will be no change in output since the lm curve is horizontal . i am not sure about those two.. so can someone tell me whether they are right or wrong ?
combine material coefficients and textures in phong shading <eos> i 'm trying to implement a simple phong shader that supports non-physically-based materials and textures . even though the material has a texture for each light component i still want the respective material coefficient to have some effect . my doubt is how to handle both of them . should i mix , multiply or sum them ? right now i 've multiplied them : ambient = material.ambient_color * light.ambient * texture_ambient ; diffuse = material.diffuse_color * light.diffuse * diffuse_strength * texture_diffuse ; specular = material.specular_color * light.specular * specular_strength * texture_specular ; it seems kinda dark , is this the correct way to combine material coefficients and textures ?

does the recent advent of a go playing computer represent artificial intelligence ? <eos> i read that in the spring of DIGIT a computer go program was finally able to beat a professional human for the first time . now that this milestone has been reached , does that represent a significant advance in artificial intelligence techniques or was it just a matter of even more processing power being applied to the problem ? what are some of the methods used to program the successful go playing program , and are those methods considered to be artificial intelligence ?
why do adjacent triangles never overlap when rasterized ? <eos> apologies for the following noob question , it 's just i ca n't find a satisfactory answer anywhere ... when i render a simple axis-aligned quad made up of two triangles , i do n't understand why there 's never any visible artefacts on the diagonal edge where those triangles meet . some of those pixels must be in both triangles , right ? so if my fragshader always emits a partially-transparent color - DIGIT black say - then should n't there be a visible dark diagonal line in the resulting quad ? obviously it 's great that this is n't a real problem that has to be coded around , i just do n't understand why it is n't . what gpu magic is it that makes this always work out ?
do non-computable functions grow asymptotically larger ? <eos> i read about busy beaver numbers and how they grow asymptotically larger than any computable function . why is this so ? is it because of the busy beaver function 's non-computability ? if so , then do all non-computable functions grow asymptotically larger than computable ones ? edit : great answers below but i would like to explain in plainer english what i understand of them . if there was a computable function f that grew faster than the busy beaver function , then this means that the busy beaver function is bounded by f. in other words , a turing machine would simply need to run for f ( n ) many steps to decide the halting problem . since we know the halting problem is undecidable , our initial presupposition is wrong . therefore , the busy beaver function grows faster than all computable functions .
is the canon ef DIGIT lens compatible with canon t2i body ? <eos> i recently upgraded to a t2i from the original digital rebel . i usually used the canon ef DIGIT lens on the old rebel . when i put that lens on the t2i after about DIGIT seconds everything goes off on the camera . turning off/on the camera does n't help , i need to switch lens and re-insert the battery to get it to work . the other lens i have from the old rebel are a canon ef 50mm 1:1.8 ii and canon ef 75-300mm 1:4-5.6 iii they both work fine . is that lens not compatible ? seems kinda weird to me .

determine the solar installation size based on w/m² solar irradiance data <eos> i have access to live solar irradiance data ( in w/m² ) at each minute of the day in my location . how do i make use of these datas to determine the solar installation size ( in kw ) ? i guess what i do n't really understand here is what really happens within the solar system the moment the sun radiate a power of say 900w/m² at that minute . does the panel immediately generate its potential power at 900w/m² solar irradiance at that minute or am i completely missing the point here ? i hope the kind fellows who will answer this question do not suggest to look for datas in kwh/m²/day to determine installation size as the internet has a lot of articles on it already .

can one make an axial mode circularly polarized radio wave filter with purely conducting materials ? <eos> can one construct a filter out of nothing but pure metal that will pass only right circular polarized radiation and reflect left circularly polarized radiation ? what would it look like ? a helical spring in a tube ? what about a twisted metalic ribbon inside a circular conducting tube ? an axial mode helical antenna transmits circularly polarized radiation . if i put an axial mode antenna ( perhaps with a resistive load ? ) in a waveguide , can i create a filter that passes only say left circularly polarized radiation ? i would ideally like to do it with only conductive ( i.e . not resistive ) material . i would also like it to reflect ( not absorb ) radiation of the opposite circular polarization . can someone tell me how to do this ?

what is the difference between derrida 's deconstruction and heidegger 's destruktion ? <eos> derrida 's deconstruction , as far as i understand it , is to critically examine values as embodied in binary situations like signifier and signified where there is an implicit hierarchy of value - one term is dominant , the other is submissive . these judgements are in fact structurally neccesary . deconstruction overturns this judgement to understand and appraise the shape of the entire situation . how does this differ from heidegger 's destruktion ? is his theory being applied in a specific but still quite general situation - that is : the text ? the text , perhaps standing in for the world if not for being ?

what relationship is there between mass of water vapour produced in combustion and the energy lost through producing this water ? <eos> i am performing a number of simple heat transfer experiments with the application of a magnetic field around the fuel line to evaluate the effects . to attempt to quantify some of the heat losses in the system i have worked out how many moles of water will be produced by combustion of a butane-propane gas mixture in air . i am hoping to find a relationship between that mass of water and the energy lost from the system by producing that water . i know the relationship between the hhv and lhv but that seems to only deal with water vapour that has been condensed into a liquid so i 'm unsure if that is any use .

how much should i feed indonesian floating frogs ? <eos> i already asked about how to make it easier to feed my frogs , but now i wonder how much they should be getting to eat . the pet store just said `` until they do n't eat the crickets '' , but i never knew if i should give them time to eat them , or just stop if they are n't eating them right away . how many crickets should i feed each frog , if i am feeding them crickets ( or is there something better i can feed them ) ? they would be adult frogs , if that helps .

does claiming something exists imply that the number DIGIT exists ? <eos> the number DIGIT is used in language when we make claims of existence concerning distinct well-defined objects . it seems then that to say the number DIGIT does not exist would imply that nothing exists at all . is this reasoning faulty ? if i need a concept whenever i make positive claims would this imply that the concept actually exists , or is it possible that a concept can have a practical purpose , being used to make positive claims in philosophy , and at the same time not exist . also , does the quantifier there exists imply there exists exactly one ?

what is crop factor and how does it relate to focal length ? <eos> i 'm reading that a 50mm lens is recommended as a first prime lens for dslr owners as it 's supposed to give a 'natural ' perspective , but when used on ( most ) dslrs , the view is cropped , as if you were zoomed in by 1.5-1.6x , so it 's more of a telephoto lens when used on a dslr . i 've also read however that the 50mm lens gives the same perspective on a dslr and a 35mm , and should n't really be considered to be 'equivalent ' to an 80mm lens as the crop factor is n't really a magic focal length changer . can someone explain how the image is different from ( for example ) a 50mm lens on a dslr and an 80mm lens ( assuming 1.6x crop factor ) on a 35mm camera ?

fantasy writing and personal philosophy <eos> i 've been writing ( and re-writing ) something for a good number of years . in the development of the story , it kind of felt like i was finding myself . in this , i feel that the fantasy world i 've created is having an effect on me philosophically . while this might be a good and a bad thing , it also dangerously blurs the line in my head and in my heart between reality and fantasy . i know this is n't a philosophy room , but i think this has happened to other authors too . my question is : is this something that can be reversed , or am i better off leaving things as they are for the purpose of more writing in the same genre ?

is there a biophysical causation from local field potential ( lfp ) to spikes ? <eos> many experiments showed that neurons tend to fire at some phase ( usually trough ) of local field potential ( lfp ) oscillations , such as theta or gamma rhythm . lfp is supposedly generated by a population of neurons with coherent currents induced by spikes . so there is a causal link from spiking activity to lfps . is there also a significant influence on the spikes directly from lfp ( not via the hidden spikes that generated the lfp ) ? is it just an epiphenomenon , and or is there a possibility that it is partly a serious mechanism for neural computation ?

what bolts should i specify with weathering steel ? <eos> when using weathering steel ( cor-ten ) on a project , what sort of bolts should i be using ? i have yet to see fixings made of weather steel ; presumably because the way it uses a sacrificial layer to form a protective rust coating makes it unsuitable for precision applications ( such as bolt threads ; maintaining the structural area , etc. ) . i am also aware that mixing different metals ; even various steel alloys , can lead to accelerated corrosion due to anodic/cathodic behaviour . so what type of bolts should be specified with weathering steel ?

baffle vs bottom temperature measurement/control <eos> in an industrial jacketed reactor , we have two temperature probes : one on a baffle the extends down about to the DIGIT fill line one built into reactor , very close to the bottom valve . when is it more reliable and practical to use one location over the other when monitoring and controlling the temperature in a chemical process ? please ignore obvious situations , such as the liquid level is too low for the baffle so the bottom must be used . i 've heard some reasons for each location . for example , baffle temperature is best when reacting at a constant temperature , or when a slurry presents possible solids buildup on the bottom probe . are there any solid industry best practices relating to this ?

how useful is the assumption that water does n't auto-ionize in the following ? <eos> now in the first row of the ice-table , $ [ ce { h3o+ } ] $ is said to be DIGIT but water autoionizes to some extent , so it should n't really be DIGIT i accept that , because the ph of this solution is 2.5 , the autoionization effect is negligible but are there instances where this ca n't be ignored ( e.g . where the ph is close to 7 ? ) ? academic , industrial ( or hobby ) examples would all be fine .

observation model jacobian for fixed transforms <eos> let 's say i have a hypothetical sensor that provides , for example , velocity estimates , and i affix that sensor at some non-zero rotational offset from the robot 's base . i also have an ekf that is estimating the robot 's velocity . normally , the innovation calculation for an ekf looks like this : $ $ y_k = z_k - h ( x_k ) $ $ in this case , $ h $ would just be the rotation matrix of the rotational offset . what are the ramifications if instead , i pre-process the sensor measurement by rotating $ z_k $ by the inverse rotation , which will put its coordinates in the frame of the robot ? can i then safely just make $ h $ the identity matrix $ i $ ?

what visual wave behaviour help to tell if a tide is going in or out ? <eos> i have always wondered how someone could tell , by a brief observation ( a few minutes at most ) , whether a tide is receding or advancing on a rainy day . assuming there is no access to tide times and the ground is completely wet due to the weather . the reason why i am emphasising a rainy day , is due to the wet sand on the ground , on a dry day , wet sand would indicate whether the tide is going in or out . on a rainy day , everything is wet , no way of telling . are there immediate waveforms or wave behaviour that could determine the direction of the tide ?

is ductile iron a good material for a support column cap ? <eos> i am planning on having some column caps made ( for lally columns ) and it seems to me the best approach would be to have them cast from ductile iron . the picture below shows the basic design : of course steel is an alternative , but i do n't trust welds and i doubt the same strength can be achieved by welding . note that those are 1/2 '' ribs , so it would be expensive to have steel cut and welded for the fabrication . is there any counter-argument to using ductile iron ?

how is heat transferred from the core through the mantle to the crust ? <eos> so , there are three main methods of transferring heat : radiation , convection/mass transfer , and conduction . presumably radiation is not a major method of heat transport between the core and the crust , because it requires transparent materials ( or a vacuum ) , and i do n't think there is much of either in the mantle . presumably conduction is the only significant method of transport in the crust , apart from volcanos . so , in the mantle , between the core , where heat is generated , and the crust , where it is eventually dissapated , what proportion of heat is transported via convection and conduction ?

why was the target block time chosen to be DIGIT minutes ? <eos> according to the wiki , DIGIT minutes was chosen as a 'tradeoff ' . why ten minutes specifically ? it is a tradeoff chosen by satoshi between propagation time of new blocks in large networks and the amount of work wasted due to chain splits . however in the original satoshi paper , DIGIT minutes is merely assumed for the purposes of calculating disk space requirements . a block header with no transactions would be about DIGIT bytes . if we suppose blocks are generated every DIGIT minutes , DIGIT bytes * DIGIT * DIGIT * DIGIT = 4.2mb per year . is there a discussion elsewhere that explains how the DIGIT minute block time was arrived at ?

acoustic guitar - how to wind strings on the tuning posts <eos> while writing an answer to this question , i did a little web searching and found that the way i was taught DIGIT years ago to wind the strings is n't necessarily the best . on an acoustic guitar , i tend to wind enough string on the posts that they 're pretty much covered up completely , winding once under the string hole and the rest of the times over , avoiding any doubling back or other messiness . is this still recommended ? is perhaps the taylor way reflective of current thought ? is this question something that can be reasonably answered , or is this simply a matter of taste ? ( edit : i 'm particularly interested in that last one . )
what advice would you give a novice in chess ? <eos> i am a bit of a new blood when it comes to chess . oh i know how to play but before i started getting more serious it was more like flailing about and hoping for the best . recently i came to the conclusion that a game like chess can be quite beneficial towards my cognitive development and i simply love the elegance and depth of the board . but i was hoping to get some advice from the more advance players . ( which from my experience level would be about everyone , lol . ) as in , what would you wish someone told you when you first started getting into playing ? how do you resist stagnation ? is there some etiquette that players are expected to know but do n't necessarily teach ?

how do you open and get a ifr clearance while in the air ? <eos> i once had a traffic controller give me a hard time about how i requested ifr clearance once in the air . i had previously filed an ifr flight plan , and took off from my untowered home airport . on approach control 's frequency , i said : tampa approach , cirrus 123ab , DIGIT miles southeast of tampa exec at DIGIT feet , ifr to ft. lauderdale exec the approach controller responded , annoyed , saying something like `` well do you have an ifr flight plan or are you reporting ifr ? ?

finding out if my crush is gay <eos> i am a middle aged man living in western europe . i have a crush on a female colleague who recently joined the company where i am working , but in a different department from me . today by random chance i saw some information suggesting that this woman might be gay . usually i do n't care if my colleagues are gay or not , but obviously given that i have a crush on this woman i do care . and though we work in an environment where being gay is nothing to be ashamed of , it still would feel inappropriate to me ( and uncomfortable ) to ask her about it . is there a good way for me to handle this situation ? is there some way to phrase the question in a not too direct fashion so as not to stir up any trouble ?
has miri produced good research ? <eos> i am not sure if this question fits ai stack exchange so feel free to delete it in case it does n't . recently i found out about somewhat famous eliezer yudkowsky and machine intelligence research institute he founded . their philosophy and organisation seem interesting but i 'm curious about their credibility . i 'm pretty sure this is not a con and they seem to be producing a lot of articles . however , few of those are published and none in the journals mentioned here . so , my question is : is miri doing a genuine high quality research ?

( how long ) would earth 's atmosphere last without a global magnetic field ? <eos> the earth 's magnetic field provides an important protection against the solar wind ( for example , see wikipedia on earth 's magnetic field and references therein ) . mars may have lost its atmosphere because it did not retain such a magnetic field , although venus does not have an intrinsic magnetic field either . this raises the question : what will happen to earth 's atmosphere if the global magnetic field would disappear ? would the solar wind blow it all away ? if so , how long would it take until only a small part ( & lt ; 10 kpa sea level pressure ) is left ?
heat escaping very old cob house <eos> i have just moved into a semi-detached house ( rented ) made out of cob , heated with a wood burner which also heats up the water for radiators and washing . there is also a large boiler , electrically heated , for hot water in the summer . the house is on two floors and there is a loft under the main roof . this seems to act as a buffer in warm a days , releasing heat at night . unfortunately the windows are single glazed and although the walls are insulating , all the heat escapes through the windows and there is a lot of condensation too . what could be some strategies to improve heat management especially in the winter ?
why did the united states not seriously develop anti aircraft missiles ? <eos> during the cold war , the united states did not seem to actively develop anti-aircraft missiles ( i know that wikipedia is not an exhaustive source for lists , but just as a rough estimate , they list seven american systems and around DIGIT soviet/russian systems ) . they seem to be cheaper , safer and easier to deploy than fighters for defensive purposes . why did the us not develop them ?

proof of angle in a semi-circle is of $ 90 $ degrees <eos> there is a well known theorem often stated as the angle in a semi-circle being $ 90 $ degrees . to be more accurate , any triangle with one of its sides being a diameter and all vertices on the circle has its angle opposite the diameter being $ 90 $ degrees . the standard proof uses isosceles triangles and is worth having as an answer , but there is also a much more intuitive proof as well ( this proof is more complicated though ) .

endgame with single bishop or single knight ? <eos> if given the choice should i opt for an endgame with a single bishop or a single knight ? i understand bishops increase in value in the endgame but is the disadvantage of covering only half the squares really compensated by increased mobility ? please consider the below possibilities ( with kings naturally always present and a couple of pawns in each case ) : bishop -vs- knight bishop and knight -vs- two knights rook and bishop -vs- rook and knight queen and bishop -vs- queen and knight my feeling is that in all cases except 1 , the bishop option is better ( since the other piece covers the whole board ) . i known that capablanca was of a different opinion but i 've read that this has not been validated empirically , at least in a statistically significant way .
how can i politely ask someone to call me ? ( as opposed to me calling them ) <eos> i recently contacted a restaurant where i had a bad experience , and a manager got back in contact with me . at the end of the email , they said : i would very much appreciate the opportunity to speak with you personally to address all of your concerns and regain your confidence in our ability to provide you with a great dining experience . please feel free to contact me directly at ( 555 ) 123-4567 or by email at name @ example.com i 'm not really comfortable making phone calls , so i am sending an email response . but it just feels much less like `` speaking with me directly '' than a phone call . how can i politely inform the person that if they still want to talk , they can call me instead ?

can i introduce myself as a self taught philosopher ? <eos> i did not ask such for pretentiousness , but for the reason that i may be characterized along with my arguments distinct of other scholars for nobody will know of my endeavor unless i tell them . i would like to do such as well for useful entitlement so as to prove that philosophers are not only those with academic credentials but as well those who is devoted to the love of wisdom even without an academic degree . i do not bother about entitlements but sometimes it is required to support your principle . so i very much require the view of the philosophy experts to this question .
does current evidence support the use of resveratrol as an anti-ageing drug ? <eos> a while back there was a lot of noise about resveratrol , a naturally occurring phenol which was touted as a potential anti-aging drug due to its role in regulating the sirt DIGIT gene . a number of studies suggested that it could extend the lifespans of model organisms such as d. melanogaster and c. elegans . has there been any follow up on this ? have there been any human trials ?

some examples about intelligent agents classes <eos> these days i searched about intelligent agents , and found that there are classes of intelligent agents such as : simple reflex agents model-based reflex agents goal-based agents utility-based agents learning agents and there were diagrams about each class of ia , about how each type works by getting percepts from sensors and acting on the environment by effectors , with a special process inbetween . and i think that ia concepts , described on those sites i 've searched , were very abstract and i 'd like to have : some examples about each class of ia . optional : some compact definition of each class . it will be helpful to compare and visualize those ia classes , and to understand well about what their working diagrams describe .
why does macbeth move to and fortify dunsinane ? <eos> the witches tell macbeth that he will be defeated only if birnam wood comes to dunsinane . this should give macbeth a very good reason to avoid dunsinsane , so that his enemies never focus on it . if i were macbeth , i would probably burn down dunsinane , and then move to another part of the country . why does he , instead , fortify it ? the prophecy does not say that he will be defeated when dunsinane is overrun ; it says that he will be defeated when birnam wood comes to dunsinane .
dandelions taking over the lawn <eos> my lawn was overrun with dandelions so i 've used some ortho weed-b-gon max and that seems to be killing the dandelions very well . the problem is now my lawn is very sparse with grass . there just was n't much grass there after killing the dandelions . i 've thought about reseeding but every bag i look at wants me to till up the ground before putting the seed down . i 've also thought about just using fertilizer but was n't sure if that would do enough or even help the dandelions survive the herbicides . what is the best approach to getting my lawn back to full grass the easist and cheapest way possible .
what would happen if a person used flea medicine on themselves ? <eos> there are many flea & amp ; tick treatments that you just put a few drops on the skin of your pet regularly and keeps them protected . lyme disease is currently problematic in my area . the drops work good for pets , so it seems reasonable they would work just as well on a person . what would happen if a person used flea & amp ; tick drops on themselves ?
why was gandalf involved with the dwarves ' quest to rob smaug ? <eos> from what i understand , the istari were sent in to help the peoples of middle-earth get through the third age . why then , did gandalf help the dwarves along ( and get bilbo involved ) in their quest to rob smaug ? it does n't seem to have any use , and i do n't remember him having shown any sign of precognition that support a theory relating to knowledge of the finding of the ring or the death of smaug .

comparative impact of individual airlines <eos> are there any significant differences to the ecological impact of flying based on which airline you choose ? the guardian seems to suggest that maximizing economy seats per plane could help determine the best airline , though i do n't know whether such information is available . has anyone heard of other ways of determining this or if any airlines have any other promising initiatives ? obviously , the ideal would be to eliminate air travel , but i 'm sure i 'm not the only one for whom this would have serious professional ramifications .
how to rationalise the coordination number of cscl versus nacl ? <eos> question : suggest an explanation for the coordination number in the $ ce { cscl } $ lattice being different from those in $ ce { nacl } $ . standard answer : caesium ion is larger than sodium ion , hence it can be surrounded by greater number of chloride ions . my questions : the question didn ’ t specify whether it is asking for the coordination number of $ ce { cs+ } $ or $ ce { cl- } $ ... is it because the coordination numbers of both ions are the same ? the given answer sounds like each $ ce { cl- } $ ion will be surrounded by less $ ce { cs+ } $ ions , how is it possible that the ratio of $ ce { cs : cl } $ is 1:1 ( as from its empirical formula ) ?

is there really a difference between agglutinative and non-agglutinative languages when spoken ? <eos> what 's the difference between agglutinative and non-agglutinative languages when spoken ? according to my understanding , agglutinative languages typically join prefixes and suffixes extensively . for instance ( although i 'm probably a bit off here ) , the word gizon in basque means man , gizona means a man ; gizonarekin means with the man . however , the written convention could easily have been perhaps gizon a for a man and gizon arekin for with the man . it would seem that basque would no longer be an agglutinative language . similarly , one could write english ( without speaking any differently ) with long compound words like forthecats or howmanymen . is the difference merely orthographical ?
the new ccmp attack against wpa/wpa2 psk <eos> the use of counter mode with cipher block chaining message authentication code protocol ( ccmp ) for wpa/wpa2 psk is being attacked . this is a trivial attack ( offline brute force ) against the initial key exchange . it should be noted that the ieee does not recognize this attack . the concern is that there is a tool called pyrit which claims to make DIGIT million password guesses per second or about DIGIT billion per day . this is made possible by using the new intel i7 chips which have the aes-ni instruction set . one of these chips costs less than $ 300 . what changes to wpa2-psk are needed in order to mitigate this attack ?
how to produce simple 2d illustrations to accompany geometry answers ? <eos> in my answer about affine transformations i made some little illustrations to help the explanation . how do you make an upload-able png quickly which expresses a geometrical or mathematical idea ? this question was contrived to support my postscript answer but is intended to solicit other solutions that may benefit the se network more generally . but for credibility , an answer must link to a post where this technique has in fact been used , as well as a sufficient `` howto '' portion if it involves more than something obvious like `` select export from menu '' . there are two meta questions here and here concerning how to scope this question in light of the precedences it may set for our site .
what is the minimum break angle for strings on a guitar ? <eos> if i am correct , the reason for string trees on certain guitars are because the strings must be at a certain angle ( the break angle ) to the nut/saddle . does anyone know what this exact angle is ? and what happens if this angle is not met ?
does depth ( number of ply ) still matter once it is high enough ? <eos> this is n't real , just imagine this happening . computer a is supercomputer . it can calculate DIGIT ply deep within DIGIT seconds . computer b is supercomputer . it can calculate DIGIT ply deep within DIGIT seconds . they play against each other chess . does these DIGIT depths really matter ? i guess that within these DIGIT depths there may be trillions way to escape a checkmate or capture of important piece . sure , computer a knows more . but computer b is able to predict future quite far too , in my opinion , far enough to defend himself really well .

optimal present wrapping with a rectangle <eos> this is a ( slightly silly ) version of penguino 's ernie gift-wrapping puzzle . you need to wrap a cubical present with side length DIGIT meter . as in the linked question , when you wrap a present , you are not allowed to cut the wrapping paper . you can only fold it to cover the cube . unfortunately , unlike in the linked question , here you have no triangle . you can only use one rectangle of wrapping paper . the rectangle can have whatever dimensions you like . you want to use the least paper possible . how small can you make the area of the rectangle ?
additional tasks for atv , htv , dragon and cygnus <eos> the progress cargo vessels are often given additional tasks of technical or scientific value . typically performed after they undock from the station . many of them participated in the series of radar-progress and plazma-progress experiments . it takes like DIGIT days of free flight before the reentry . progress m-13m has been used as an orbit-to-orbit tug to bring chibis-m to DIGIT km orbit . progress m-04m took part in the reflection experiment , and so spent DIGIT weeks in autonomous flight . etc etc . the tradition goes well into mir ( and may be even salyut ) times . are atv , htv , dragon and cygnus also used as something more than just cargo delivery ?

what is 'the morbid association between the cannibal and the nutcracker ' ? <eos> in the book `` constellation of vital phenomena '' ( anthony marra ) sonja remembers visiting anatomy and pathology museum in london . there she stumbles upon an exhibit of a skull of a cannibal . the placard says : `` there are no characteristics to distinguish the cranium of a cannibal from that of an ordinary man '' the next line says : `` the morbid association between the cannibal and the nutcracker ... '' i am not sure i understood what association sonja ( or , rather , the author ) had in mind . is it simply due to the fact that sonja bought the nutcracker the same day she visited the museum ? i guess there is greater significance attached to it , something i failed to notice .

dynamically allocating morph targets in shaders <eos> so with the idea that i want to load in an object with morph targets and for simplicity sake i know it will have between DIGIT position morph targets . ultimately i want to do renderedprimitive.position = primitive.position + weights [ 0 ] * primitive.targets [ 0 ] .position + ... . weights [ n ] * primitive.targets [ n ] .position ; but being open to load in any model how do you go about knowing the number of vertex input attributes to allocate . getting the cpu side dynamically is not an issue , but am i wrong that the only way around this is building your shader with some # define and compiling during runtime ?

duration of harvest season from bush bean plants ? <eos> was wondering what a typical duration of production for a conventional bush bean is . i know a lot of factors such as how well the plants are cared for and heat can play into it . here in the northeast us i 've had a solid three weeks of beans out of a few different varieties and they all have pretty much stopped flowering at this point . they are well cared for and get between 1 '' -2 '' of water weekly however i think it may be time to pull them up and plant again . is three weeks of beans good or is it advised to stick it out and let them remain although they 've greatly slowed ?
equivalent ( true ) martingale measures and no-arbitrage conditions <eos> i hope this is the correct site for this question , as it is rather theoretical ... in their famous paper , delbaen and schachermayer proved that the no free lunch with vanishing risk condition is equivalent to the existence of the equivalent local martingale measure . are there any stronger no-arbitrage type conditions that guarantee that this measure is a true martingale measure ( i.e . that all discounted asset prices are true martingales as opposed to merely local ones ) ? i would be grateful for ( academic ) references .

what was the significance of the branded tattoo on miranda ? <eos> after bruce and miranda shared an intimate moment , they cuddled by the fire . at one point , miranda gets up and we are given a clear shot of some form of branding on her skin . it was n't clear to me if this was intended for bruce or just for the audience , but i do n't remember seeing that branding anywhere else in the movie ; or the series for that matter . i have to assume it had something to do with the league of shadows , but i 'm just not sure .
how do i get google notifier ( mac ) to report the number of new messages in priority inbox ? <eos> i 'm using google notifier for mac DIGIT and i want it to report the number of new messages in priority inbox . previously , i had notifier report the number of unread messages that had a certain label assigned to it ( it was a quasi-priority inbox ) . i set up the notifier by going into terminal and typing : defaults write com.google.gmailnotifier label -string `` label '' when i substitute out label for priority inbox , it does n't provide an accurate unread count : defaults write com.google.gmailnotifier label -string `` priority inbox '' does n't it make complete sense that google notifier and priority inbox should work together ? !

how much of the song of wandering aengus by yeats is based on irish folklore ? <eos> yeats was a keen student of irish folklore and it is clear that the titular character in his poem the song of wandering aengus is based on the pre-christian celtic god of love , youth and poetry . however , little of what happens on the poem can be directly linked to surviving stories about the deeds of the god aengus . why , then did yeats choose this figure and what other narrative or imagery from the poem can be linked to the mythical figure ? i am particularly interested in whether there is any precedent to similes of the closing lines the silver apples of the moon , the golden apples of the sun . since these seem to have been inspirational to other authors following on from yeats including ray bradbury and hope mirrlees .

taxonomy for plasmids <eos> i liked the question about f ' and r plasmids . what is a good resource that describes what is known about the functions and diversity of plasmids in the wild ? prokaryotes or eukaryotes ? wikipedia points to five kinds of plasmids ( fertility ( f ) , resistance ( r ) , col plasmids ( offensive genes that let a bacteria kill other bacteria ) , degradative function plasmids , and virulence plasmids ) . there is a brief section on yeast/euk plasmids too . it seems like plasmids could actually convey nearly any gene . restriction enzymes are found mostly on plasmids and they would seem to be defensive - maybe those are degradative . are there references that are more detailed and nuanced ?
can an evergreen fern be adapted for indoor use ? <eos> i was hoping to find a fern houseplant at the gardening store , but the next best thing i could find was a potted evergreen fern , dryopteris affinis crispa . i would have thought it 's small size and shady conditions would be suitable for indoor use , but i 'm having difficulty watering the plant sufficiently without it flooding the tray beneath the pot . not much information is given on the plant label . at the moment , the plant is in a medium sized pot filled with multi-purpose compost in the garden .
is there any democratic non-secular state ? <eos> i do n't know any democratic non-secular state . and i think that this is impossible . since if there is no separation between state and religion , it means that in such a democratic country the state religion should be the religion of the majority . however in any religion there are religious leaders who have authority over the people . so they would gain the most authority in such a state . is or was there any example of such a state ?

who would have to pay for the damage resulting from sitting on a freshly painted bench ? <eos> when a bench in a public area gets repainted/lacquered , there ’ s typically a sign that reads `` wet paint ! `` , which should warn people not to sit on the bench . a blind person can ’ t read this sign , sits down , and gets dirty clothes . who would have to pay for the damage ( dry cleaning / replacement ) ? the owner of the bench ( typically the city ) , the painting business ( for not sufficiently cordoning off the bench ) , or the blind person ? ( i ’ m primarily interested in germany , but it would be interesting to know if other jurisdictions handle this differently . )
can the oldest man in the world die ? <eos> in the news , i read `` recently , the oldest man in the world died .

the stable marriage algorithm with asymmetric arrays <eos> i have a question about the stable marriage algorithm , for what i know it can only be used when i have arrays with the same number of elements for building the preference and the ranking matrices . for example if we have DIGIT students that should be assigned to DIGIT dorms , then i can build the preference and ranking matrix of this data . the question that i have is what to do in the case that i have , for example , only DIGIT students to assign and for example DIGIT dorms . can i still apply the stable marriage algorithm ? maybe this question is a little bit foolish , but as i said i only saw this algorithm applied to quadratic arrays .

list of english words that came from specific words in latin <eos> most english words can be traced to their latin , greek , or other roots in any common dictionary . however , is there a latin-to-english counterpart that would list current english words that are derived from a specific latin word ? the question stems from coming across the terms `` servatis a periculo '' and `` servatis a malefico '' from an evanescence song . after discovering that the english word `` saviour '' is derived from `` servatis '' the meaning of the phrases becomes easier to grasp . i am not actively studying latin so access to such a resource would help greatly in the few times that i need to understand a latin word . thanks .

what is a good tool and format for representing and communicating the design content of a survey ? <eos> are there any decent tools for writing/designing questionnaires before providing to programmers ? currently microsoft word is being used and tracking changes and keeping it standardized has become a headache . update : i think i 'm being a little misunderstood here . here 's a scenario : a client speaks to a statistician/expert in survey design so they can design a survey to receive feedback from their customers . once that survey is designed ( not in the fashion sense ) they might give it to an artist and programmer to actually create the survey ( for the web or whatever ) . i am wondering what some good ways to communicate the logical design of the survey to the programmer might be .

why does `` convex function '' mean `` concave *up* '' ? <eos> a function $ f : mathbb { r } to mathbb { r } $ is convex ( or `` concave up '' ) provided that for all $ x , y in mathbb { r } $ and $ t in [ 0,1 ] $ , $ $ f ( tx + ( 1-t ) y ) le tf ( x ) + ( 1-t ) f ( y ) . $ $ equivalently , a line segment between two points on the graph lies above the graph , the region above the graph is convex , etc . i want to know why the word `` convex '' goes with the inequality in this direction , and how i can remember it . every reason i have heard makes just as much sense applied to the opposite inequality ( `` concave down '' ) .
how do you keep yourself motivated when you are doing mostly self-study ? <eos> there are numerous reasons one might have to resort to mostly self-study - lack of good teachers in the vicinity , lack of good players to interact with face to face , lack of time/money to attend classes etc . provided one can come up with a workable self study plan , it is not easy to maintain the levels of motivation needed to reach high levels of expertise through every single practice session . how do you keep yourself motivated ? your answer will help if you 're in this or a similar situation , but answers on general motivational techniques for musicians are also welcome . i can not add tags yet ( would have added self-study , motivation if i could ) , so have opted for learning .

what does it mean for an axiom to be logical ? <eos> i have recently been hearing the phrase logical axiom being thrown around in reference to the philosophy of mathematics and i 'm having a hard time understanding what one might mean when they are using it . by the use of the word logical i am tempted to believe that whatever word is to follow has been somehow obtained through a logical sequence of steps . if an axiom is something that is assumed true in absence of a logical sequence of steps , it is a bit difficult for me to understand what one means by qualifying it as logical .

does quantum mechanics suggest that our scientific method is flawed ? <eos> some quantum mechanics experiments seem to suggest that our current understanding of reality is flawed . entanglement experiments show us that particles separated in space , can still somehow communicate - and they interact instantaneously ( faster than the speed of light ) . some `` which way '' / '' cosmic eraser '' variations of the double slit experiment suggest that this communication might actually be `` faster '' than instantaneous . if the effect in some experiments can precede their cause , does that mean our basic scientific method is flawed ?
