what scheduling software do you use ? <eos> in my office we currently use ical to keep track of when a room is booked and with who , and then just keep a paper work order to log hours through the session . when we were just starting out with a few rooms it was perfect . as we 've grown over the years , it has been able to adapt , but it 's a method that is starting to show some holes . i 've used scheduall before , but it 's way more than what were looking for , both in features and in price . i 've found fasttrack schedule DIGIT which seems like a contender . but i wanted to see if anybody here has a personal recommendation of scheduling software that changed their life .

how is the interest on fractional reserve money creation paid ? <eos> in fractional reserve banking commercial banks create money when they make loans . when these loans are paid back the account is zeroed , the created money disappears , but the bank is still entitled interest . where does the money to pay the interest come from ? does the central bank necessarily have to inflate the currency to pay it ? does money in circulation generally cover it ?
including an academic reference for a job in the industry ? <eos> would it be beneficial to include an academic reference for a job in the industry ? what if that reference is a senior like the head of a department or a principal ? when i talk about an academic reference , i mean a reference from a university . edit : the reference was my teacher and i was a very good performer.he is the most senior person in our university ( being one of the few 'professors ' , not lecturer or assistant professor ) . he has also written a few books which are used in other universities as standard course material.not mentioning several research publications .
how do co-authors ' rights to a manuscript work ? <eos> when an individual writes a novel , he owns all rights over the manuscript until he starts selling those rights to others . what is the situation when the novel is a collaborative work ? how are such rights as `` first publication rights '' and `` movie rights '' defined when the rights are held jointly by two individual authors ? obviously a duo can determine an individual agreement , but my question is what the `` default '' definition of the rights are absent a formal agreement . additionally , i would like to know whether on the death of one author , the rights are considered to revert to the collaborator , or to the author 's estate . i could see strong intuitive cases in both directions , and would like to know what the ruling is in practice .
when should fpgas be used in robotics ? <eos> fpga has good points such as a lot of io points but then again you need to think things on very low level with flip-flops and pioneer on areas where things are not yet mature -- for example see this question here about development-tools on fpgas -- this is my understanding currently ! now fpga has been used to create excellent dexterity in robotic hands like here . now some people market fpga for fast prototyping and `` forward looking '' designs like here , i do n't fully understand them : if you do n't need a lot of io points for things such as sensors , why to choose fpga for a robot ? so when should fpga be chosen for a project in robotics ?
secure development costs <eos> what case-studies or references are available from companies who have implemented a secure development process ( eg , sdl or similar ) around the cost/effort involved . whilst each development department is likely to be a unique case , it is still important to understand roughly what the costs of a programme would be before spending a lot of time on scoping . some references available are this recent article which links to this aberdeen group which looks to have some interesting information and this reference here . it 's a bit academic and formula heavy , but some interesting information

how to calculate libration amplitude of objects orbiting the $ l_4 $ , $ l_5 $ ? <eos> is there a way to calculate the libration amplitude of a test object that orbits the $ l_4 $ or $ l_5 $ lagrange points ? by amplitude i mean the distance along the orbit between the two extremes of libration . i.e . the point in the tadpole orbit ( as examined in a co-rotating frame ) where the orbiting test object is farthest from the planet , and then the point at the other extreme where the test object most closely approaches the planet before turning back toward the $ l_5 $ ( or $ l_4 $ ) . without working out any equations , on the surface it seems that the amplitude ( as well as whether the object is in a tadpole or horseshoe orbit ) will depend on the energy the test object has when it is captured . is that a safe assumption ?
what does a phonemic rewrite mean ? <eos> we have been doing phonemic rules in class , and our professor says to write a `` phonemic rewrite '' of words based on these rules , where these words are written like so `` /_/ '' . while i understand the concept of phonemes and their representation in the slashes , i dont understand it when words are represented in those slashes or what a phonemic rewrite is . can someone please elaborate on this ? unfortunately , my textbook does not cover it .

what are the objections to implementing a flat rate income tax in the united states ? <eos> some of the most heated politics debates are about taxes , and who should get taxed more and who should get taxed less on their income . but there rarely seems to be any debate in us politics as to whether everyone 's income should get taxed at an equal rate - e.g . flat tax . ( aside from one gop presidencial candidate in 2012 , no other major political figure openly advocated this ) , which may be argued is the fairest approach as far as people being treated equally under the law . what are the main stated objections to implementing stated tax in the united states ?

should i bathe my hamster ? <eos> while reading the hamsterific hamster faq , i read about never giving hamsters a bath . that 's a naughty word in the hamster world ; hamsters do n't like water sports . nature has provided hamsters with a natural oil to maintain the condition of their fur . that 's why they spend so much time grooming . although they can swim , water baths are not recommended . if a wet hamster becomes cold , it can lead to flu and possibly death . the last line really puzzled me . it inferred that wetting a hamster could lead to its death . is it true that wetting a hamster could be fatal for it ? if so , how effective is their skin oil at keeping their skin clean and comfortable ? should i bathe my hamster ?
are isolated passed pawns good or bad ? <eos> i frequently face situations in the late middle game ( perhaps only a one minor piece and a rook or two on each side , no queens ) where i can force a position ( via exchanges ) where both players are materially equal but i have an isolated passed pawn on the 4th or 5th rank . i have heard that isolated pawns are bad ( because they can not be supported by other pawns ) but also that passed pawns are good . are isolated passed pawns generally good or bad ? is it good to create them ? i realize the answer probably depends on the position , so guidelines for determining when such pawns are good or bad would make for a great answer .

policy relevance of the optimal taxation given uncertainty about social welfare specification <eos> one common criticism in the optimal taxation literature is the specification of the social welfare function . the optimal taxation literature ( i have the mirrlees framework in mind ) relies on first specifying a social welfare function . however , because we never observe the social welfare function ( swf ) and because we 're not even sure if a reasonable specification of social welfare can be represented by a utilitarian-like swf , what kind of policy prescriptions can we get out of these types of models ? how much of a problem is this ? are there potential ways in which this problem can be made less offensive ?

correct way to find the mean of annual geometric returns of monthly returns ? <eos> say i 'm given i set of monthly returns over DIGIT years on a monthly basis . what is the correct way to find the geometric returns of this data ? i ask because a classmate and i are on different sides of the coin . i found the cumulative returns of each year , then found the geometric mean of the DIGIT years . he found the cumulative returns of the entire time period , then took the ( months in a year / total months ) root of that data . the numbers turn out to be very close , but if i remember correctly mine are slightly lower over all the funds we measured . or is there a different way and we 're both wrong ?
unsupervised alien natural language learning <eos> while conducting research , i recently stumbled upon the deep learning and natural language processing concepts . in this question they say that the ‘ grammar induction ’ is a ‘ supervised learning ’ mode . so i was wondering : let ’ s say that there ’ s a way-more-than-human intelligent alien probe orbiting our planet . it can receive , decode and analyze all the broadcasting signals leaving the earth . for all we know at this moment , how could it learn the basics of a language with nothing else but our broadcasting signals , so without the help from a ‘ supervisor ’ ? how would an artificial intelligence human engineer ( theoretically ? ) face the problem ? i ’ m interested on the more “ technical ” side of the issue .

does a pond have to be covered with a net during fall ? <eos> there are several different trees and bushes surrounding our pond . as fall season peaks , the amount of leaves and needles falling into the pond gets quite high . there are koi , sturgeon and goldfish living in the pond . we have a skimmer to clean the surface water , though floating material always accumulates in some corners of the pond . there is no guarantee the skimmer is cleaned as regularly as it is during fall . another access point for the pump is at the lowest spot of the pond , to keep the base of the pond free of dirt . my main concern is that a net makes the pond look far uglier than uncollected/un-skimmed floating material . given these conditions , is there any reason to cover the pond with a net during fall season ?

what is in the contents of the second alien message in rollback ? <eos> i 've been reading about the novel rollback by robert j. sawyer the novel appears to center around longevity treatments and a pair of messages sent by an alien race to earth , one message in DIGIT and one in DIGIT the novel centers around the human race trying to decode the second message . i 've searched all over to find out what is in the second message , but there do n't appear to be any good spoilers for this one . i 'm not interested enough to read the book , so i 'm curious what happens at the end . what is in the content of the second alien message ?
mining and the transportation of resources <eos> with the recent bootstrapping of so many space centric companies , it 's starting to look like our economy will extend beyond the bounds of earth sooner rather than later . assuming that mining companies such as planetary resources succeed and other companies force competition , how important will it be for methods of transporting materials to earth to become cheap ? for example , would cheaper & amp ; longer paths such as hohmann transfers be favored , or will more direct ( and therefore more expensive ) trajectories be preferred ? for this question we narrow the source of material to the main asteroid belt and assume that resource needs to be brought within earths soi .

how to simultaneously spoon feed twins ? <eos> my wife and i are on different schedules which during the week leaves one parent alone with the twins . feeding the twins bottles at the same time has proven to be relatively easy . we are now in the process of introducing solid foods . this has proven challenging for one of the twins and is proving challenging for us . spoon feeding is obviously not as simple as holding onto two bottles , but requires interaction for each bite . we see our options as : alternating between each bite feeding one and then the other spoon feeding at totally different times is there an option we are missing ? is there a better way ?

simplification of expressions containing radicals <eos> as an example , consider the polynomial $ f ( x ) = x^3 + x - DIGIT = ( x - 1 ) ( x^2 + x + 2 ) $ which clearly has a root $ x = 1 $ . but we can also find the roots using cardano 's method , which leads to $ $ x = sqrt [ 3 ] { sqrt { 28/27 } + 1 } - sqrt [ 3 ] { sqrt { 28/27 } - 1 } $ $ and two other roots . it 's easy to check numerically that this expression is really equal to $ 1 $ , but is there a way to derive it algebraically which is n't equivalent to showing that this expression satisfies $ f ( x ) = 0 $ ?
would something like the uncertainty principle arise even if the universe was built on something like newtonian mechanics ? <eos> i am thinking of a ( greatly simplified ) computer simulation of a universe that followed something like newtonian rules . inside the simulation are a.i.s that are made from those same rules , and can only use those rules interact the world around them . would there be some fundamental limits on what those a.i.s could work out about their universe , like their own version of an uncertainty principle ? sorry for phrasing this question in such a convoluted way . if anyone recognises what i am asking , and can point me in the right direction that would be appreciated .
what are the most important elements of poker to model in a monte carlo simulation ? <eos> a few years back , i built a mc simulation with the following parameters : betting was n't simulated fixed number of players cards were dealt , and then flop/turn/river the best hand was recorded after running millions of iterations , this gave a good ranking of initial hands . other projects got in the way , and i have n't had time to develop it further . what other elements have you found useful in your simulations ? what elements would you like to see simulated ?

why has n't there been an encryption algorithm that is based on the known np-hard problems ? <eos> most of today 's encryption , such as the rsa , relies on the integer factorization , which is not believed to be a np-hard problem , but it belongs to bqp , which makes it vulnerable to quantum computers . i wonder , why has there not been an encryption algorithm which is based on an known np-hard problem . it sounds ( at least in theory ) like it would make a better encryption algorithm than a one which is not proven to be np-hard .

how do i approach people for a natural look in street photography ? <eos> i am enjoying taking candid photos of people , but the subject is usually someone i know , or it is during some family/friend event , so after a while the people get used to the presence of the camera and act quite naturally . i like `` street photography '' which captures ordinary people in everyday situations and i am thinking about giving it a try . if you have experience in that type of photography , could you share some tips on how to approach people in a way that the the presence of the camera is not too obtrusive , and you can achieve the natural look on your photos ? i am not interested in paparazzi-style shooting using telephoto lenses , but more in photos taken within the range of 24-85mm lens , which means that you need to be pretty close to the subject .

how does alcohol affect the ability to speak a second language ? <eos> from my own experience , drinking alcohol has both positive and negative effects to the ability of speaking a second language . on the one hand , it facilitates the process , mainly because one gets more relaxed and less inhibited ( thus caring less about making mistakes , as long as one gets the message across ) . on the other hand , alcohol affects muscle control , makes reasoning slower , impacts memory and so on . these are all extremely important abilities when speaking a second language , so the intoxication makes it harder . so , my question is : have the effects of alcohol on second language speaking been studied scientifically ? what are the main results ?

what do all the $ k $ -cycles in $ s_n $ generate ? <eos> why do n't $ 3 $ -cycles generate the symmetric group ? was asked earlier today . the proof is essentially that $ 3 $ -cycles are even permutations , and products of even permutations are even . so : do the $ 3 $ -cycles generate the alternating group ? similarly , do the $ k $ -cycles generate the alternating group when $ k $ is odd ? and do the $ k $ -cycles generate the symmetric group when $ k $ is even ? i know that transpositions ( $ 2 $ -cycles ) generate the symmetric group .
what material is available to teach a toddler how to read ? <eos> my 3yr old has been asking us to teach her how to read . she can recognize a decent amount of the alphabet , and picks stuff up pretty quickly ( when she wants to . ) we have thought about picking some basic words and teaching sight reading , but we would rather go straight to phonetic reading . is that possible , or should we stick to sight reading at this age ? i have had people tell me ( anecdotal at best ) that it is a little more difficult for a kid to go from sight reading to phonetic . is this true ? is there any good material to help out ? is there any good material to help out ?
how do extreme values scale with sample size ? <eos> assume i have a random vector $ x = { x_1 , x_2 , ... , x_n } $ , composed of i.i.d . binomially distributed values . if it would simplify the problem substantially , we can approximate them as normally distributed . given that all other parameters are fixed , i want to know how $ e [ min ( x ) ] $ ( the expected value of the smallest number in the vector $ x $ ) scales with $ n $ . i do n't care about a precise answer . i just want to know how it scales , i.e . linearly ( obviously not ) , exponentially , power law , etc .

are normative definitions possible in ordinary language philosophy ? <eos> if i recall correctly , analyzing a concept in ordinary-language philosophy involved taking inventory on how the term for the concept is used by the speakers of the language across contexts , thus revealing a family of related concepts for which the word stands . at first blush , this methodology does n't seem to leave much room for discussions of what a given term ought to mean , or what concept or concepts ought to answer to a given term . but is this a mistaken or limited view of ordinary language philosophy ? could ordinary language philosophers discuss what , for example , what terms such as `` morally permissible '' ought to mean ?

what does the malvolio subplot add to twelfth night ? <eos> most of shakespeare 's comedy twelfth night is about the group of main characters viola , sebastian , orsino , and olivia , and the affections requited and unrequited between them . but there 's also a subplot surrounding olivia 's steward malvolio and her other servants , which seems completely unrelated to the rest of the play . it adds more slapstick comedy to the play which might otherwise be rather more serious , but also has a dark element when malvolio is imprisoned and tormented before vowing revenge on his tormentors . why is this subplot part of the play ? what does it add to the story ? are we just meant to laugh at the fooling around of the servants , or to be affected by malvolio 's pathos ? does it connect in some metaphorical or symbolic sense to the main plot ?

liquid micrometeorites compared to solids <eos> i 'm reading about the 30-or-so ussr rorsat missions that had unshielded , fast spectrum , highly enriched uranium nuclear reactors powering a satellite , which was later moved up to a higher `` disposal '' orbit . apparently one of the biggest debris issues is the liquid nak ( former ) coolant leaking . but these are just liquid droplets . i can easily see how the number of drops would multiply much faster than solid metal breaking up ... but how do the impact risks compare ? will a liquid drop do the same impact damage as a solid chunk of metal of the same mass ?
first-price auction with discrete values <eos> exercise DIGIT in vijay krishna 's auction theory : suppose that bidder DIGIT always has value $ x_1=2 $ , while bidder 2 's value , $ x_2 $ is equally likely to be $ 0 $ or $ 2 $ . find equilibrium bidding strategies in a first-price auction . ( note that since values are discrete , the equilibrium will be in mixed strategies . ) i do n't understand why it is that since values are discrete , the equilibrium will be in mixed strategies . is there some rule/principle to this ? how do i set up for the problem ? since equilibrium are in mixed strategies , i can suppose that player DIGIT bids $ b_1 , ldots , b_k $ with probabilities $ p_1 , ldots , p_k $ respectively . but that seems too general to make any progress .

an indexing function for graphs <eos> definition from wikipedia : a graph is an ordered pair $ g = ( v , e ) $ comprising a set $ v $ of nodes together with a set $ e $ of edges , which are two-element subsets of $ v $ . the set of all finite graphs ( modulo isomorphism : we do n't want nodes to have identities ) is countable and could be enumerated . but what would be an efficient ( low-complexity , from a programming point of view ) injection from graphs to $ mathbb { n } $ ? edit : gilles ' comment indicates that it is not know whether there is a such function feasible in polynomial time . an example of an exponential-complexity function would be good enough ; we can surely do better than a brute enumeration ?

kids that build some sort of space craft <eos> this movie was about a bunch of kids that were building a type of space ship and they built something that projected a bubble around their craft and this bubble allowed them to travel great distances fast etc . i remember one scene , they fired ( accidental or not i can not remember ) this bubble in the ground and it made a huge hole into the earth , which seemed to go on forever . i vaguely remember one of the kids remarked `` its probably half way to china now '' , but i could have mistaken this quote . it sounds a lot like an 1980 's science fiction movie , but as to the cast and other plots i can not remember .

why would someone want to simulate emotional desicion-making within an ai ? <eos> the mario lives ! video ( and its follow-up video , mario becomes social ! ) showcases an ai unit that is able to simulate emotional desicion-making within a virtual world , and can enter into `` emotional states '' such as curiosity , hunger , happiness , and fear . while this seems cool and exciting ( especially for video game ai ) , i am confused how this would be useful in real-world scenarios . what would be the point of building autonomous actors that would behave based on these emotional states , instead of simply knowing what they should do ( either by hardcoding in the rules , or learning the rules through machine learning ) ?

how to distribute items of varying sizes into bins of varying sizes , such that percent utilization across all bins is minimized ? <eos> i have a bunch of databases , each having different access patterns , such that each puts a different amount of load on its database cluster . i would like to distribute them around my set of database clusters such that the workload for the clusters is evenly distributed . i looked at the k-partition problem , which sounds close to what i want , except each of my database clusters has a different load capacity . that means i need an algorithm that minimizes what percent of load capacity is used on all clusters , whereas the k-partition problem minimizes the integer load on each cluster . does such an algorithm exist ? and can anyone point me to a sample implementation of it ?

best help for a tree with stunted growth ? <eos> i have a few trees on my property which are at least five years old ( sorry i do n't know the kinds yet ) . compared to other trees in neighboring lots , planted at the same age at the same time , they are notably stunted , short , and devoid of many branches . they are alive and well , with new growth and green leaves , but are not growing taller and branching . i suspect a soil problem , but it could also be due to a history of underwatering . what steps can i take to turn these trees around , and help them grow properly ?

how do you handle bilingual education in a country where you do not speak the language natively ? <eos> our DIGIT year old son is growing up in a different country ( new zealand ) than we did ( brazil ) . we try to speak to him in portuguese all times , and we noticed that he is learning english reasonably well at the daycare . obviously he does not understand that he speaks DIGIT different languages yet . but , once he realizes it , i am afraid he will lose interest in portuguese , since he only speaks that with us . for the people who raised a bilingual child . how did you keep them speaking both languages ? what were the challenges ?
could magnetorquers be used on the iss ? <eos> the way that the iss manages it 's attitude now is to use a set of reaction wheels for primary control , and occasionally firing small thrusters to allow the wheels to despin themselves . this is n't always a practical response , as it uses fuel continually . the way that many satellites manage to do this is with magnetorquers , which align themselves with the earths magnetic field , albeit in an active way . what i want to know is , under what conditions would the management of the space station be too difficult using only magnetorquers ? could only magnetorquers be used to control it , and if only some of the time , when would the most difficult times to use them arise ?
genetic models for natural selection ? <eos> my question is simple : given that evolution is described by random genetic mutations allowing certain members of a species to gain a reproductive advantage over others that coexist in the particular environment- i am curious- single genetic mutations do not seem to really explain complex morphic changes such as the length of a giraffes neck . instead it appears it must be a compilation of many such mutations . so what are the statistics for mutations ? how long does it really take for so many to favorably compile ? how does this compare with the reproductive time of the species ?

why has the supreme court of the united states not used its power of judicial review to audit constitutionally-questionable laws like the patriot act ? <eos> i 've heard it said that it is very difficult for some terrorism-related laws like the patriot act or laws that allow warrantless dragnet surveillance of citizens to be fully challenged in the courts because it is difficult to prove that an individual has been specifically `` wronged '' by it . however , if i understand correctly , the scotus has the power of judicial review , which allows them to proactively audit the constitutionality of legislation passed by congress . it seems like this could be the perfect antidote to the above scenario . why does the scotus not do this when so many citizens question the constitutionality of these laws ? is there a petition process that an ordinary citizen could follow to request that scotus perform such a review ?

how to simulate earth 's gravity in future colonies on other planets ? <eos> what would be a viable means to simulate and maintain earth 's gravitational acceleration in a future colony built on another planet ? i am mainly focusing on terrestrial planets , where a colony could be built on the surface , such as on mercury , venus , luna , mars , gas and ice giant moons , minor and dwarf planets where the gravitational constant is less than on earth . or would it instead be a case of a specific physiological adaptation occurring over time to the lower gravitational effects on these planets ?

why should children be rewarded for good behaviour ? <eos> i have been reading about star charts and other reward systems for children , and wonder whether rewarding what i would call normal behaviour ( e.g . do your chores , do n't hit your little brother , etc ) is not counter-productive in the long-run . if children are raised on the premise that they should get something every time they do something that is really part of their daily normal routine , wo n't they carry this type of expectations into adulthood ? is it better to limit rewards to behaviour that exceeds expectations ? note : i guess this question may trigger opinions rather than answers so looking to the community to provide guidance and perhaps reword the question differently .

should i prefer an amd or nvidia gpu for studying graphics programming , especially with respect to vendor specific debugging tools and ecosystem ? <eos> my current laptop has a fairly old intel integrated gpu which was good enough for following simple tutorials . i am now keen on getting to grips with advanced techniques and newer apis , and so i am looking for a new discrete gpu . i want to ignore the usual price/performance metric for gpus , as i assume that 's going to be irrelevant for a hobbyist programmer . is there a pragmatic reason to prefer amd over nvidia or vice versa ? a cursory search shows that some tools are exclusive to one vendor ( e.g . nvidia nsight ) , but is one significantly better than the other or are the differences minor ? will drivers make a difference here also ? and finally will i run into a lot of example code specific to one vendor ?
why do people singing in english sound like americans ? <eos> this is just my observation , but it seems like standard american english lacks any distinct accent when speaking . listen to almost any person singing with an accent , and they sound like any american singing ! i suppose this could be because america has had so many accents thrown on to it that it 's averaged out , perhaps . is there any explanation for this ?

effect of real world brands and/or places on story tone <eos> this is based on that question , but from a tone point of view . let 's say i have a story taking place in a near-future version of boston , characters are meeting for coffee . i have no issue saying the story is in boston . however , having the characters `` meet in starbucks '' sounds ... wrong . similarly , using real locations and landmarks often seems weird , especially if it is in a place i know well ( i live in boston ) . what are the advantages and disadvantages of using real world brands and places ? when should it or should it not be used ? ( again , i am not asking for copyright advice , as it was well covered by the above question . )

recommend me a remote shutter release <eos> i 'd like to embark on a self portrait photo-a-day project with my rebel xsi & amp ; 50mm f/1.8 lens . the problem is that the built-in timer wo n't work for this - the af kicks in when you press the shutter button , rather than when the timer reaches zero . at that point i 'm not in the frame and the photo turns out blurry . i 've tried manually focusing on the spot where i intend to stand , but it 's awfully hit-or-miss . what i 'd like to do is compose the shot and manually select the af point , then step into the frame and release the shutter remotely . is there a remote which is capable of triggering the af mechanism like this ? it 's not clear to me that this is even possible .

when did the use of fabricated speeches in historical works go out of fashion ? <eos> in his history of the peloponnesian war , thucydides includes a number of made up speeches based upon `` what was called for in each situation '' . while this is frowned upon in modern histories , it seems to have been perfectly acceptable practice then and their inclusion had no bearing on the historicity of the rest of the work . every work by an ancient historian that i have read contains such speeches , although the quality and relevance to the situation varies . what was the first documented case of a historian expressing opposition to the use of fabricated speeches ? when did the practice begin to lose acceptance amongst historians in general ? what were the reasons for this change of view ?

a friend gifted me a relatively expensive present , what present is appropriate for me to give him back <eos> i 've been given a smart-watch as new year present by a friend . i did n't expect it and did n't think our presents are going to be in that higher price range . now i 'm conflicted about what to do . i hate being indebted , so i feel like i must get him a present at least in similar price range . i wonder though what can be done to prevent such situations in the future - when you are given an expensive gift which forces you to retaliate with something of similar value , even if you did n't budget plan it ? or is it really necessary to do - from etiquette point of view ?

can the production rate of labs-on-a-chip ever reach the production rate of silicon chips ? <eos> labs-on-a-chip and silicon chips both have the potential - and in some cases have already reached the potential - to drastically scale down tasks , in these cases performing chemical reactions and performing computations . part of the appeal of silicon chips is - besides their size - is that they can be easily mass-produced . labs-on-a-chip have tremendous potential , but they are in the early stages of development . can labs-on-a-chip be mass-produced in the same way that silicon chips are mass-produced ?
why do string theory and hopf algebra renormalization seem to have no intersection ? <eos> hopf algebra appears in recent papers that systematize renormalization of quantum field theory ( qft ) . for example see connes ' work and citing papers or a paper referenced here on pse : r. e. borcherds , `` renormalization and quantum field theory '' URL this seems to be an effort that is separate from string theory , but i wonder if they are compatible . since `` compatible '' is perhaps too loose of a term , i 'm asking : why do string theory and hopf algebra renormalization seem to have no intersection ? if the reader feels the question could be improved by rewriting , please so assist .

my fingers are huge ; how do i adjust on a piano ? <eos> i 'm a big guy and my fingers are proportionately big . i 've been a student of piano for a few months now . i 'm told regularly that i should play `` into the keyboard '' so that my fingers are closer to the back of the keyboard , but whenever i do , i seem to have problems playing white keys without the sides of my fingers bringing down the black keys by sheer friction . my only real idea to compensate is to be able to quickly move my hands forward and back for when i need to play black keys but this wo n't work when playing chords that require both black and white keys . how should i compensate for this ?
when and how can we stop giving our toddler formula in the evening ? <eos> my toddler gets a bottle of formula in the evening , as part of the bedtime ritual . at some point in time , we 'd want to stop giving that bottle and stop using formula at all . what is an effective method to do this ? is it realistic to just stop giving the bottle one day ? or should the daily amount be reduced over a two weeks until nothing is left ? or should we replace it with water ? ideally , we would want no more fluid intake in the evening to prevent future bed-wetting , so replacing with water could at best be a temporary solution . i have a feeling that an evening drink increases the risk of bed-wetting , though it would probably be naive to expect it can be fully avoided .

is a random sample of a poisson distribution also poisson distributed ? <eos> car analogy : assume the traffic ( number of cars per hour ) on a road has a poisson distribution , and the time between cars has the matching exponential distribution . if the chance of each car being red is independent from both time and the color of other cars , will the number of red cars per hour also have a poisson distribution ? i strongly suspect so . furthermore i expect e ( red cars ) =p ( red ) * e ( cars ) , and because of the poisson distribution σ ( red cars ) = p ( red ) * σ ( cars ) . but how would i ( dis ) prove this ?

optimise drawing contour maps representing gravity <eos> i 'm drawing a contour map representing gravity . the algorithm is : for each point on the screen ( 1 pixel per point ) i calculate the gravitational pull for each object and combine ( using newtons law of universal gravitation ) where m1 is a unit point mass . next i get the min and max values and create a palette of DIGIT colors scaled over this range . i then generate a texture from this data . for resolutions such as DIGIT * DIGIT or greater this is expensive ( takes > 1sec ) i 'd like to be able to move the masses and see the contour map change in real time . any suggestions on how to optimise ?

ray tracing with thin lens camera <eos> i 'm reading cook 's paper `` stochastic sampling and distributed ray tracing '' , i do n't understand how the rays are generated . he says : determine the focal point by constructing a ray from the eye point ( center of the lens ) through the screen location of the ray . the focal point is located on this ray so its distance from the eye point is equal to the focal distance . i ca n't parse this image . where is my screen plane located according to this image ? what is the focal point ? if you see some optics picture of a thin lens , the focal point is always in the same place , where all the rays converge . if it is always the same point , why do have i to calculate it for each ray ?

how do purely statistical machine translators deal with different word orders ? <eos> even relatively closely related languages can differ greatly in word order . take english and german for instance . english is pretty boringly subject-verb-object whereas in german the finite verb must come second , all other verbs go to the end , and separable prefixes also all go to the end . according to machine translation lore , the systems work better in inverse proportion to the number of linguists in the project . so given a complete lack of understanding of the source language how do machine translation systems manage these different word orders ? do they actually have to know some linguistics after all and hence are not so pure as touted ? or do they actually do worse that touted under these conditions . or are there statistical methods that somehow take into account even word ordering differences without recourse to linguistic knowledge ?

are there any truly sustainable business models ? <eos> i would like to start a sustainable ecovillage , but am worried about the ad-hoc nature of so many previous attempts that often assume we will just all `` get along '' without a formal structure . while `` business model '' may seem oxymoronic to such a venture , i hope to find what it will take to make sure the participants can continue to be productive and successful without the entire organization either withering into insignificance or morphing into yet another typical corporation . i also view the cooperative approach as hardly any different from capitalism , so would rather not just hand the thinking over to that tired approach .

why is spider silent ? <eos> sound is a major defining component of the woman in black : many of the imaginary and semi-present elements of the performance get explicit sound cues . they 're a diegetic conceit of the framing device , and serve to make the pantomime more understandable . so why is the dog spider , who is entirely invisible and only given presence through the actors ' pantomimed interactions , not given any sound effect cues at all ? even when the dialog narrates cues like `` she is yelping loudly , '' the sound direction never backs it up .

forensics on a soho router <eos> i am interested in how reliable the information determined from doing forensics on a soho router is . most of these routers do n't seem to be very advanced , so i question if it would be possible to detect tampering . if logfiles had been changed for example , could this be detected ? given that they use flash memory , would there be remnants of previous incarnations of the file to sue as evidence ? if you need to make a case that a soho router was tampered with in any way , what steps could you take to establish this and then what would you provide as evidence ?

how much precision do i need in my g-buffer ? <eos> i 'm in the process of working out how to pack all the information i need for a physically based deferred renderer into a g-buffer without using an obscene amount of render targets . what i have so far is DIGIT 3-part vectors : albedo/diffuse normal tangent position and DIGIT single components metallic roughness height ambient occlusion a naive approach is to bundle one of the single components into the alpha ( fourth ) channel with one of the 3-part vectors , which is my current line of investigation . however , given that four 4-channel full precision floating point render targets is n't small i understand it 's common to use half precision and even smaller representations to be more memory conscious . what i 'm asking is : which components can i safely cut precision down on without losing quality , and by how much ?

buckling : do buckling mode shapes of n > DIGIT occur in reality ? <eos> in the buckling of columns we know that : $ $ p = dfrac { n^2pi^2ei } { l^2 } $ $ the smallest value of p occurs when $ n=1 $ which gives a simple buckling shape ( one wave ) : $ $ p_ { cr } = dfrac { pi^2ei } { l^2 } $ $ however for $ n & gt ; 1 $ , as shown below the buckling shape is more complex and has many waves : my question is do the buckling mode shapes for $ n & gt ; 1 $ ever occur in reality ? if the column begins to buckle as per the shape for $ n = 1 $ then would n't it just continue to buckle like this until failure ? how would the other buckling modes ever occur ?

how good is ai in math ? <eos> currently ai is advancing fast in deep learning : entire human chess knowledge learned and surpassed by deepmind 's alphazero in four hours . as a layman , i 'm taking this as a quite powerful searching algorithm , using artificial neural networks to identify the patterns of each game . however , how good is ai doing in math ? for example , the key to the theory of the game nim is the binary digital sum of the heap sizes , that is , the sum ( in binary ) neglecting all carries from one digit to another . this operation is also known as `` exclusive or '' ( xor ) or `` vector addition over gf ( 2 ) '' . is ai good enough to discover/invite operations/logics such as `` exclusive or '' , or , more advanced , abstract algebra in finite field ?

why does fide still use elo ? <eos> i 've been impressed with the way the glicko rating system works . in particular : more games played recently cause your rating to stabilize fewer games played recently cause your rating to fluctuate until you get several recent games under your belt uscf modified their system to be similar a few years back ( where there is a sliding scale to amplify or dampen the rating change for a given match ) , and now that glickman ( the inventor of glicko ) is on the rating board for the uscf , i imagine they 'll eventually adopt an even more flexible system , like his own . is there a reason ( other than being resistant to change , or that they just have n't gotten around to it yet ) that fide does n't adopt a more accurate rating system ?
what essentials should you bring with you on a day hike ? <eos> possible duplicate : what are essential items in an emergency kit ? another question asked about emergency supplies you 'd bring on a multi-day hiking trip . but many people prefer going on shorter day hikes ( say , leaving in the morning and returning to the trailhead in the late afternoon ) where it 's less practical to bring a large backpack with every conceivable emergency supply . besides appropriate clothes and water , what equipment would you consider essential to bring on a day hike ( for safety , comfort , protection , etc . ) ?

is there a vipassana meditation in the mahayana tradition ? <eos> i was brought up in the theravada tradition and have little knowledge on mahayana . recently some of my friends participated in a mahayana retreat and praised it highly . one of them even claimed that mahayana is for practical buddhists and theravada is for rituals and ceremonies etc . so i got a bit curious about this and started searching on mahayana . but i could n't find the answer to my main question . as vipassana meditation is the core of theravada which finally leads to the end of suffering , can someone tell me if there exists such a meditation technique in mahayana as well ?
is it common among hobby-snooker-players to play for money ? <eos> snooker is a very popular game in great britain and ireland . most top-players come from these isles . nearly DIGIT probably . i do n't know the history of this sport , on tv it looks a bit elitist , fine dressed players : ) i 'm asking if it is common to play snooker for money in britain , because it could somehow explain to me why most top-players come from there , more competition , incentive for good players . in germany it 's not really popular and we play mostly for fun and not those several hours lasting matches . so do many non-top but good hobby-players in great britain play for substantial money amounts in clubs and pubs ? it looks similar to poker like a luck & amp ; skill game , where betting money would seem normal when playing longer matches

how is texas eviction process different from california 's ? <eos> for people moving from california to texas ( the direction of the migration is paramount and hard to dispute ) , and who may be familiar with the eviction process in california , what would be the differences with that in texas ? for example , in texas , i 've noticed that a lot of agreements prohibit the tenant from withholding rent , whereas in california , tenants have the right to withhold rent and `` repair and deduct '' ( for people in san francisco who do n't necessarily care about their credit , it might be cheaper to pay a retainer than continue paying rent , and under certain circumstances , they practically can not be evicted through a jury trial ) . e.g. , what notices are required , how much time in advance , how soon does a case have to be heard etc .
stop avoiding bad news <eos> i have a problem that hinders me in several places in life where , when i believe that bad news is imminent , i take up sometimes outrageous levels of inconvenience and anti-productive behavior to avoid hearing the bad news . the reason for this is that bad news seems to impact me more negatively than other people -- i seem to have a harder time shaking it , and it seems to impact my productivity more drastically than i see in other people , once you control for how bad the news is . how can i train myself to firstly not be so avoidant , and secondly , learn to bounce back from things better ? does anyone have experience with therapy in this area ? if so , could it realistically lead to better outcomes ?

why did islamic philosophy refer to the stoic philosophers as the 'pneumatics ' ? <eos> in glasners averroes ' physics he writes : the arabs [ islamic philosophers or falsafa ] were well familiar with stoic logic , as well as with the basic ideas of stoic philosophy . they learned about the stoic school mainly from secondary sources and referred to them as ‘ the pneumatics ’ ( ruhaiyyun ) . this seems an odd choice of nomenclature . from my superficial knowledge of stoic philosophy there does n't appear to be a characteristic of stoic philosophy that this name is honouring . is there something i 'm missing ?
how is the equilibrium of DIGIT oxygen in earth 's atmosphere established ? <eos> the atmosphere is DIGIT oxygen . i assume that there must be an equilibrium between processes that produce oxygen ( e.g . photosynthesis ) and those that consume oxygen ( e.g . aerobic respiration ) . moreover , there should be a self-regulatory negative feedback which restores the equilibrium if the system is driven away from it . if the amount of oxygen were increased , something that would subsequently cause it to decrease over time , and if the amount of oxygen were decreased , something to cause it to be replenished . what processes are responsible for this negative feedback ?

how will cloud feedback effects on the climate change as the result of global warming ? <eos> so global warming will increase the tropospheric temperatures , which , in turn , would make the clouds higher than they otherwise would be . and higher clouds ( especially cirrus clouds ) tend to trap in more long-wave radiation . it 's the low clouds ( like marine stratus ) that reflect away incoming shortwave radiation while not trapping in more long-wave radiation . so my question is this : would global warming increase these feedback effects due to increasing the cloud heights ? ( and perhaps decreasing the amount of marine stratus clouds ? ) if status clouds gave way to cumulus clouds , what would be their net effects on earth 's radiative budget ?

are there any problems that are easy to compute but hard to verify ? <eos> assuming p $ neq $ np , np-complete problems are `` hard to solve , but have answers that are easy to check . '' does it make any sense to consider the opposite , that is , problems for which it 's easy to compute a correct answer , but hard to verify an arbitrary purported solution ? i think such a problem would imply either : exponentially many `` correct '' answers for any given input , because otherwise verification could be carried out by simply computing all of the correct answers . some `` correct '' answers are easy to compute , but others are difficult to find .
how do canon 's pricing tiers work with new models ? <eos> when a new model of a particular class of canon camera comes out , will it be introduced at the same price as the model it replaces , or will it be more costly ? apple do this with the macs - they update the specs but keep the price points fairly static relative to the previous model . i 'm wondering about this specifically because the canon 60d should be announced pretty soon , but the currently available 50d is within my price range . i 'm sort of concerned that if i wait , the 60d will bump up out of my price range and it will be hard to source a 50d .

what is the accepted method of converting shininess to roughness , and vice versa ? <eos> most modern renderers use physically-based materials and their models are often parameterized over roughness . since this was n't always the case with renderers , conventional assets often do n't have a notion of roughness . instead , we see `` shininess '' or `` specular power '' as a common material parameter . i understand that there is no exact conversion between the two , but is there a rule-of-thumb / approximate way to get roughness for a material whose specular power or shininess is known ?

'' `` ohnot too bad '' the child has evidently heard people saying responding to `` how are you ?

how to layout left hand fingers correctly ? <eos> i practice flamenco guitar . basically all music sheets that i read indicates the left hand fingers ( 1 , 2 , DIGIT and 4 ) . this is amazingly helpful because you can complicate a lot of things if you are using unsuitable left hand fingers . but there are a lot of music sheets that do n't show the notion of the left hand , this makes me spend a lot of time trying to figure out and wondering if i 'm using the best left hand fingers positioning . how can i know if i 'm laying out my left hand fingers correctly ? how to develop this instinct to become natural like all guitar players ? ( just let me emphase that i read music sheets and i do n't use tabs , not sure if this could affect the answers ) .

what is the ideal location for a human habitat on mars ? <eos> would anyone have any insights or articles on the best location to land on mars for a manned mission where the crew would establish their base and live on mars for a couple months ? ( but i know we are not ready to live long-term on mars ) edit : sorry for the broadness . i meant more in terms of the best location to land in terms of habitability , since the crew will be establishing base and living on it for several months . or could it be said that the location would not matter , since technology could negate the differences in location ( e.g . technology could keep the temeperature ideal ) ? i would appreciate any insights or any new information that i could learn .

what is an example of a utility function where one good is inferior ? <eos> say the consumer has a standard convex , monotonic preference over apples and bananas . ( update : i 'd like the preference to be as 'standard ' as possible . so ideally we have diminishing mrs everywhere and we also have `` more is better '' everywhere . ) say his preference can be represented by some utility function $ u ( a , b ) $ . he must satisfy some budget constraint $ p_aa+p_bb=y $ , where $ y $ is his income . then what is an example of a utility function in which $ frac { partial a } { partial y } & lt ; 0 $ , at least under some circumstances ? this seems to me a very simple question but briefly googling i 'm unable to find anything .

tethering to control zoom on nikon dslr <eos> most nikon dslr have a tethered capture option , however i have n't come across any of them that controls the zoom of the dslr . i guess the zoom is controlled manually by rotating the ring on the lens . on the web i have come across several attempts of controlling the zoom by mounting a motor on the camera with a belt that wraps across the zoom ring . something like this . my first question are there any off the shelf solutions for auto zoom control ? additionally i tend to shoot a lot of objects that are static but different in sizes . second question is there a zoom to fit option available for dslr 's where i can autocompose and the object fits in the frame with the proper zoom level ?

how glvertexattribpointer works ? <eos> i know that when you call glvertexattribpointer , you are specifying how the buffer currently binded should take its own data . but if you can have binded one buffer per type ( let 's say gl_array_buffer and gl_element_array_buffer ) then , are you specifying two buffers simultaneously ? in this tutorial says : glvertexattribpointer always refers to whatever buffer is bound to gl_array_buffer at the time that this function is called . therefore it does not take a buffer object handle ; it simply uses the handle we bound previously . if glvertexattribpointer refers to the gl_array_buffer buffer currently binded , how i call glvertexattribpointer for the gl_element_array_buffer buffer ?

why do n't horizontal stabilizers have winglets ? <eos> winglets are used to reduce induced drag on the main wings of an aircraft as per explanations on wikipedia . since they are very effective i was wondering why they are not installed also on horizontal stabilizers . for sure there must be some sort of induced drag being generated on horizontal stabilizers too as they are cutting through the air just as the main wings do . so why are n't there any sort of `` minified '' winglets available as an aftermarket installation ( or , at least , i have n't ever seen some myself ) ?

glomerular filtration rate <eos> in practice , when you have vasoconstriction of the glomerular capillaries and subsequently an increase in blood pressure , glomerular filtration rate increases . however , this seems counterintuitive to bernoulli 's principle . during vasoconstriction , because the radii of the capillaries are getting smaller , we should expect an increase in flow rate and blood velocity . according to bernoulli 's principle , the outward hydrostatic pressure should drop . how does this lead to an increase in filtration rate ?

is it legal to drop/shoot paintballs from an airplane ? <eos> my brother and i are big into paint balling and aviation , and we 've often wondered if it would be legal/possible to use an aircraft in a large scale paintball match ? mainly to drop paintballs , or perhaps even bags of paint , onto participants to simulate air support . a few questions then , to cover this fully : is it even legal to begin with ? assuming it is legal , what is the recommended way to do this ? plane size ? configuration considerations ? lastly , is it legal to shoot back at the plane ? or is that just wildly unsafe ? i know , it 's kind of a broader question , but i was hoping to get the entire answer in one place for ease of access to the answer .

is there a liquid crystal or similar material that gets cloudy when an electric field is applied , but is otherwise clear ? <eos> is there a way to make a liquid , such as a liquid crystal material , transition from cloudy or clear and vice-versa using only electric current ? by cloudy , i mean , similar to the effect that cholesterol or 5cb exhibits , thermally . if so , where could this be obtained , and how quickly does it switch between states ? if not , how else might such an effect be achieved using electric current ? i 've read about the kerr effect , but it did n't change opacity so much as refractive index , and it also appeared to use a great deal of electricity . i 'm thinking something within the single volts .

the needle in the network - find it ! <eos> we all know it can be difficult to find a needle in a haystack , but in this puzzle you have to find the needle in the network ! a bit more detailed : somewhere in the network pictured above hides the word needle encoded in a rather well known cipher . ( you will find examples of the used cipher on puzzlingse in several other puzzles . ) the task is to find it ( and the used cipher ) . particulars : the image alone constitutes the puzzle . it is visual and no information is hidden in its digital representation . ( if you want , you can draw the same image by hand . ) the solution requires a cipher to be applied , i.e . the word `` needle '' is encoded not just visually hidden or obscured .

how does a teleconverter affect depth of field ? <eos> i 'm aware that a teleconverter will reduce the amount of light reaching the film or sensor in a camera , and as such you hear people banding around things like `` with a 2x teleconverter this 300mm f/2.8 becomes a 600mm f/5.6 '' . given the aperture is n't physically any different , i wonder how that affects depth of field ( and associated effects like bokeh ) . it would make sense that the depth of field remains the same , and the image is merely cropped . is it just another one of these things that people say , that may be convenient for exposure calculations , or is there actually a change in the image produced ?

can an e-ttl ii cable trigger a speedlite in manual mode <eos> essentially , if you own an e-ttl ii ( or presumably ittl ) cable of a certain length/type , is there any reason to also own a manual pc-sync cable of a similar length/type , or can the camera be fired in manual mode via the e-ttl cable . i presume it can , and so getting a pc-sync cable would be redundant for those just starting to get into flash , and not owning studio flashes or anything other than a speedlite , since it looks like it just maps all the connections on the camera hotshoe to another hotshoe a length of cable away , but i 'd like confirmation of this before i disgard the idea of buying a cheaper pc-sync cable to experiment with manual flash before moving on to e-ttl stuff .

why would wittgenstein say we ca n't have a perfect language ? <eos> i have been reading wittgenstein 's philosophical investigations and my question is how does he come to realize that we ca n't have a perfect language . for instance i would say math is a perfect language because one can never mistaken DIGIT to mean DIGIT or addition to mean subtraction . math in my opinion , perfectly represents the universals as well as the particulars , which is why i think there is never any misrepresentation . so in his words why would he say we ca n't have a perfect language ? note : i think its because he thinks language is used as a tool and is never exact , that it is all dependent on the context . but i do n't how he comes to this conclusion , why ca n't all words mean an exact thing ?

can a jacobian matrix be used to derive joint angles from end-effector linear and rotational velocity ( without a filter ) ? <eos> i have a 2-link , DIGIT degree of freedom robotic arm , that only measures linear acceleration at each link ( through an accelerometer ) , and rotational velocity on each joint ( through a gyroscope ) . i know that through using the jacobian matrix , i can compute link velocity and acceleration from joint angles , and through the inverse of the matrix i can compute joint velocities from joint angles and link acceleration . however , i am not sure if i can compute joint angles using only the link linear and rotational acceleration ? i am aware that the joint angle could be estimated by integrating the joint velocities ( and applying some sort of filter ) , but is there an algebraic way this can be computed ? it does n't seem likely to me .
how widespread is attachment parenting ? <eos> ever since bumping on dr. sears ' `` baby book '' i 've become interested in attachement parenting and found a lot of resources on the internet . but i 'm wondering how widespread this kind of parenting actually is . i read somewhere also that it 's kind of `` fashionable '' . of course one thing is theory and another is practice and there must be many different levels of application of the attachement parenting philosophy . so my question is : is there some statistics or estimate of how many or what percentage of parents claim or can be viewed as applying attachment parenting ?

why does skew measure remain more-or-less constant for listed expiries ? <eos> i have looked at the variance swap papers published by gs-varswap and jpm-varswap where they talk about approximation to varswap strike using atmf vol and skew ( slope of the volatility skew for DIGIT strikes ) . but , i have also come across another 'skew measure ' which is defined as $ $ mathrm { skew } = frac { sqrt { t } ( sigma_1 - sigma_2 ) } { log ( k_1/k_2 ) } . $ $ i understand that $ sqrt { t } $ makes the vol difference 'normalized ' in maturity-space . and to my surprise , this measure remains almost constant for mid-to-long term maturities ( > 6m ) . my questions are what could be the assumption behind taking log-strikes instead of absolute strikes ? what is the intuition behind this measure being constant for different maturities for a given underlying ?

will ais ever be as advanced as the human brain ? <eos> i 'm reading a book about a hypothetical economy in which robots work for us because they eventually became able to do everything we do ( `` our work here is done , visions of a robot economy '' by nesta ) . i was wondering though : is it theoretically possible for a human brain ( an extremely complex artificial intelligence the way i and many others see it ) to comprehend itself in its deepest details and produce an artifical intelligence which is exactly identical ? it sounds unlikely . if not then , how close can we get ? this is not a philosophic question , the ideal answer would be a rigorous demonstration based on metrics simplifying the problem to be able to answer it , however objective answers with valid arguments are always interesting , too .
what stories for children have strong female role models ? <eos> i notice that just about all young children 's stories ( fairy tales , etc ) depict women in a subordinate role . this hit me while reading cinderella : her ultimate goal in life is to be the prettiest so that she can marry the rich boy and make babies . more generally , females are absent , or if present , they 're following boys or performing household tasks . having two daughters , i ca n't help but think that they 'll in some way absorb this cultural baggage . i would rather raise them to be self-reliant and independent , and ready to embrace desires other than cooking and finding a boyfriend . can anyone recommend any good sources of beginner-level books/movies/etc that have a more egalitarian approach ?

plotting deflection of a beam <eos> i have a formula to compute the deflection of a beam . when i have computed the deflection i get a vector with non-negative elements representing the deflection in each position on the beam . when i am plotting the deflection vector i get a downwards parabola since the elements are positive . but now i found this plot somewhere else i guess the plot illustrates how the beam is bending at positions where loads are placed . is it correct to get negative deflections ? i wonder if i need to multiply my elements in my deflection vector by DIGIT in order to obtain the same plot as shown here .
formally describing a new domain specific programming language <eos> i am about to implement a domain specific language for representation of social learning conventions . part of the implementation is a formal description of a language - its 'calculus ' , symbols and logical expressions . my approach would be to describe the language by describing its grammar but there are also concepts such as relations , dialogs , expectations that require more theoretic approach and the description of the logic . i would like to ask for an example and a literature recommendation ( papers , books ) that would help me with this description . i feel relatively competent approaching this task so i am not asking for a total hand holding , but help from a theoretician in this area would be greatly appreciated .

can an enclosed pelton turbine be used as a pump ? <eos> can an enclosed pelton turbine be used as a pump , perhaps through the centrifugal forces created in a enclosed pelton turbine when it rotates at speed ? the water striking out of the buckets of a pelton turbine is left with diminished energy but because the wheel is rotating continuously at high speeds due to very high velocity water jet then , is there any possibility of development of centrifugal forces that may lift up the water through a discharge pipe connected to the casing of the turbine which actually happens in centrifugal pumps ? is there any possibility of this , even if this happens to a small degree ? can create centrifugal forces lift the water , so it functions as pump and turbine simultaneously ? please suggest any means by which we could pump the discharged water via a pelton turbine .

would a biological resource-system be feasible for long-term manned flights ? <eos> supposing a long-term manned flight is planned would a biological resource-system be considered as an option ? would a biological resource-system work or is a technical solution superior ? currently technical solutions turn urine into drinkable water again and turn co2 ( carbon dioxide ) to o2 ( oxygen ) [ and c ( carbon ) ] . would the same be feasible with plants or other biological solutions ? this is n't limited to oxygen and water ; food could be grown as well . would it be considered or dismissed , because testing such a system could be difficult .

how do i determine what a paleo diet is ? <eos> prior to the invention of agriculture , humans lived in numerous climates , ecosystems and environments . so , exactly what is a `` paleo '' diet ? for example , at some point in time before the origin of agriculture , there were `` paleo '' humans who ate grains . the original grain eaters were no doubt hunter-gatherers who happened to live in a region where grains were a `` gathered '' food source . another example is an acquaintance who follows a paleo diet , but eats a large amount of boneless , skinless chicken breasts . this strikes me as odd , because from what i understand , hunter-gatherers did n't limit themselves to breast meat . is there a link perhaps with good clarification on exactly what a paleo diet is ?

adverse effects on soundfields from plug-in processing <eos> i 've heard tales of plug-ins and effects processes doing bad things to the spatial perception of a soundfield . of course , most of those tales come out of the music industry , where a mastering engineer has to restore or widen the stereo image because it has completely collapsed after an inexperienced mixing engineer has slapped some plugin ( s ) on the master output bus ( the most common offeneder listed is a compressor ) . it 's been a while since i worked heavily in music , and most people in our line of work are n't usually throwing global processes onto our mixes , so i have n't ever encountered this . has anyone had this issue when working on a film/tv mix ? if so , what were the circumstances .

what are some examples of individualism in ancient greek philosophy ? <eos> when people speak about disrupting action , an action that often goes against the commonly accepted moral laws , the pople that comes to my mind are nietzsche , d'annunzio , marinetti and the italian futurism . are there any ancient greek philosophers who had similar thoughts ? in this answer i read : according to epicurus , eudaimonia is achieved by successfully pursuing and maximizing pleasure . the catch is that the only way to successfully pursue and maximize one 's pleasure is to practice virtue . in epicureanism , virtue is nothing more than a means to an end , but it is the only possible means , so it is still a necessary condition of eudaimonia . so probably epicurus is not what i am looking for .

physics and math behind flight through solar system <eos> i wrote a program that simulates a solar system . i was able to calculate the locations for every planet on its elliptical route for any given time . in a second project , i managed to simulate newtonian gravitational behavior ( n-body problem , time-step approach ) . but i 'm wondering how it is possible to : ( 1 ) find routes ( different possibilities ) from a given location/planet to another ( 2 ) choose the best route according to duration or fuel consumption so where 's a good place to start ? to be more exact : it 's not about writing another simulation , it 's about understanding the physics behind it !

do traversable wormholes exist as solutions to string theory ? <eos> there has been some heated debate as to whether the laws of physics allow for traversable wormholes . some physicists claim we require exotic matter to construct wormholes , but then others counter the casimir effect with ordinary matter is sufficient . but these same physicists seldom come up with an explicit solution or state of ordinary matter keeping the throat of a wormhole open via the casimir effect . yet others claim with extra dimensions , a gauss-bonnet interaction is sufficient to keep the wormhole throat open , but opposing physicists claim such a term ca n't arise from string theory . so , my question is , do traversable wormholes exist as solutions to string theory ?

how large is the energy difference between keto- and enol-form of guanine and uracil ? <eos> the nucleobases in dna and rna are generally present in the keto-form , and not in the enol-form . as an interesting historical note , james watson and francis crick did initially believe them to adopt the enol-form , which is n't compatible with the correct model of the dna they later proposed . but there are some reports indicating that in certain rna structures guanosine and uridine form essentially a watson-crick basepair where one of the two bases is present in the enol-form , instead of the usual g-u wobble base pair . is there anything known on how large the energy difference between the keto- and the enol-form of those bases actually is ?

how do you formally prove that rotation is a linear transformation ? <eos> the fact that rotation about an angle is a linear transformation is both important ( for example , this is used to prove the sine/cosine angle addition formulas ; see how can i understand and prove the & quot ; sum and difference formulas & quot ; in trigonometry ? ) and somewhat intuitive geometrically . however , even if this fact seems fairly obvious ( at least from a diagram ) , how does one turn the picture proof into a formal proof ? on a related note , it seems likely that many formal proofs using a diagram will end up relying on euclidean geometry ( using angle/side congruence properties ) , but is n't one of the points of linear algebra to avoid using euclidean geometry explicitly ?

warn about specific ca in firefox <eos> consider a setup where all http/https traffic goes through a proxy . the certificate of this proxy must be trusted by all browsers ( in this case , firefox ) . this certificate replaces the original certificate for all https connections to hosts which are not in a whitelist maintained by the sysadmin . as such , all https traffic to non-whitelisted hosts can be inspected at the proxy . to check whether a connection has been whitelisted , i can simply right-click and go to view page info & rarr ; security to see the `` verified by '' field . this is a bit of a cludge , and i do n't want to have to go through these steps manually for every https connection . so how can i display the certificate issuer for the current connection at all times in firefox ?
will a cedar tree grow new limbs ? <eos> i 've got a cedar tree that divided into two smaller trees , and the previous owners tried to keep the twin trunks together by tying a rope around them . the rope eventually strangled one of the trunks , and now it 's dead ; at least , all the needles are brown and it does n't look good . so , i think the thing to do is to cut down the dead trunk , but this will leave half the tree bare . the question is , will the remaining trunk eventually grow branches in the newly cleared space , or will it just keep growing up and out on the side where it already has branches , and never fill in the open space ?

how to automatically project texture from high poly mesh to low poly mesh ? <eos> i have two aligned meshes : i have exact mapping from each vertex of low poly mesh to surface of a high poly mesh . high poly ( ~100k vertices ) mesh is non-manifold , low poly ( ~1k vertices ) is manifold and allows cylindrical texture mapping and each vertex has a normal . what algorithms can i use to project supersampled texture ( albedo/diffuse and normal maps ) from high poly mesh to low poly mesh ? it would be great to have not only a paper , but implementation as well .
scientific studies on the default duration of a pomodoro ? <eos> i was wondering about the default duration of a pomodoro ( 25 minutes ) . in the pdf on the pomodoro technique ( 1 ) it says : the length of a pomodoro , DIGIT minutes , seems short enough to make it possible to resist being distracted by various kinds of interruptions . this seems to suggest that DIGIT minutes is just a random duration taken by the author which happens to work for him and which many people now seem to use . are there any scientific studies that indicate that DIGIT minutes is the optimal time ( for most people and most tasks ) for a pomodoro ? ( 1 ) the original link is broken . it seems the pdf is no longer available on the pomodorotechnique.com , most likely because they are now selling a book . the old pdf can still be found here

available code for computing solutions to matching algorithms ? <eos> the question of designing matching procedure ( between high-schools and students , med intern and hospitals , kidney donors and receivers , ... ) has been widely studied by economists and vastly contributed to roth and shapley receiving the nobel memorial price in economics . i was wondering if you knew about any freely available code out there ( ideally in a relatively high-level language ) able to compute solutions to the main kind matching problems for some of the most famous algorithms proposed in the literature . i am thinking of writing one , but i 'd rather not it already exists . i am chiefly interested in some piece of code to compute the solution to deferred acceptance algorithm in a school choice problem , but anything else would be appreciated .
why did n't the silk road run north of the black sea ? <eos> i have read many times that the only way for europeans to get to china , or vice versa , was through anatolia and persia . this gave istanbul an advantage in throttling trade , as well as mesopotamia and locations in persia . i am sure that due to climate considerations , those were the easiest routes , but when those were blocked by unfriendly regimes , why did n't trade or travel go north of the caspian and black seas ? through what today is called kazakhstan and ukraine ? is there a reason that it was particularly difficult to go that way ? i have never read about any significant traffic that way . on the contrary , it is usually stated that the only way to china was through persia .

spontaneous inequilibrium in a gas in an isolated system ? <eos> can an isolated system ( of several phases ) in equilibrium by itself move out of equilibrium ? if a system contains for example an inflammable gas dispersed with another combustible gas such that the molecular speed are insufficient to cause the reaction . but as the molecular speeds keep fluctuating , at some point , it may cross the energy barrier and may start the reaction which will eventually spread evenly but till then the temperature there would be high and thus the system in inequilibrium . is n't this also an example that although the free energy is minimum and entropy maximum , some useful work would 've been done if the temperature gradient had been utilised ?

adding elements to a sorted array <eos> what would be the fastest way of doing this ( from an algorithmic perspective , as well as a practical matter ) ? i was thinking something along the following lines . i could add to the end of an array and then use bubblesort as it has a best case ( totally sorted array at start ) that is close to this , and has linear running time ( in the best case ) . on the other hand , if i know that i start out with a sorted array , i can use a binary search to find out the insertion point for a given element . my hunch is that the second way is nearly optimal , but curious to see what is out there . how can this best be done ?

how can i spend less time optimizing and more time executing ? <eos> i love tools . i can ( and often do ! ) spend lots of time fiddling with the settings of the tool ( to-do list , project plan , whatever ) . i know i should stop tweaking the tool and start working on the listed tasks but i often go back and tweak a little more , knowing it 's a nearly total waste of time . it seems i 'm keeping myself busy with `` meta '' stuff rather than diving into the actual tasks . it 's a form of procrastination i guess , except that i do work on actual tasks as well ; i just often interrupt myself to fiddle with the system , just for the sake of using the system because i like to use it . how can i spend less time optimizing and more time executing ?

should i re-shuffle my data ? <eos> we have a set biological samples that was pretty expensive to obtain . we put these samples through a series of tests to generate data that are used for building a predictive model . for this purpose we have divided the samples to training ( 70 % ) and testing ( 30 % ) sets . we have successfully created a model and applied it on the testing set to discover that the performance was `` less than optimal '' . the experimentalists now want to improve the biological tests in order to create a better model . provided that we can not obtain new samples , would you suggest us to re-shuffle the samples to create new training and validation sets or to stick with the original division . ( we do n't have any indication that the division was a problematic one ) .
all in situation with side pot <eos> following situation : player 1 : 100 $ player 2 : 100 $ playe 3 : 50 $ player DIGIT makes `` all in '' - all other players call . so i guess it 's main pot : 150 $ side pot ( for p1 and p2 ) : 100 $ player DIGIT wins . obviously he get 's the 150 $ . now additionally let 's say p2 has a better hand then p1 ( e.g . a better pair , while p1 has a lower pair ) , does p1 need to give the side pot money still to p2 ? or does only the winner get something and the rest ( side pot ) goes back to the corresponding players ?
how much heat can a cherry chili pepper withstand ? <eos> how about DIGIT to DIGIT degree celsius ? in the morning , usually the temperature is quite high , and sometimes it goes up to 40+ . i help to lower the temperature in the morning just once before i go to work . other plants like holy basil , patchouli , lemon verbena , french lavender are all alive in such condition . all of them are in earthen pots , which helps to reduce the core temperature of the soil because it releases heat from the soil faster . i gave the lavenders some water in their pottery tray and they are fine . what i wonder is how well can the chili pepper do .

is this comment right about subadditivity ? <eos> i found this comment in a book i bought about risk management : risk management in banking by joel bessis . this is the well-known rule that states that the sum of individual risks is less than the risk of the sum , or , that risks should be sub-additive . risks do not add up algebraically because of diversification . does n't he really mean the opposite , namely that the risk of the sum is less than the sum of the individuals : $ $ rho ( a+b ) leq rho ( a ) + rho ( b ) $ $ or is his wording just odd ?

can i determine the pixel geometry programmatically ? <eos> different screens can have different pixel geometry , so that the red , green and blue components are arranged in different patterns . using sub-pixel rendering to give a higher apparent resolution is only possible if the pixel geometry is known ( what will give an improvement in clarity on one type of monitor will make things worse on another ) . this is particularly relevant if an application needs to run on both a desktop/laptop and a mobile screen , as different pixel geometry is quite common in mobile screens . is there a way to determine which geometry the screen uses at runtime , without having to ask the user ? i 'm interested in whether this is possible in general , but ideally i 'd like to know whether this is possible when using javascript with webgl .

how can i generate mazes that often have multiple `` forks '' or choices ? <eos> the basic algorithm for procedurally generating mazes goes something like this : choose a random available direction from the current square . if there is one , go there and repeat from step DIGIT otherwise , backtrack to the previous square and repeat from step DIGIT this is a fairly good algorithm , but the problem is that it typically generates easy mazes . they usually only have one option or path , and alternate paths do n't appear very often and reach dead-ends quickly . how could i alter the algorithm ( or change it entirely ) to create more branching ?

sample selection and variation in the variable of interest when using panel data <eos> i wonder how to reason when selecting samples . i am doing a panel data regression analysis about how the euro membership correlates with the budget deficit in the member countriues . using r that is : budgetdeficit ~ eurodummy + some_controll_variables eurodummy is the variable of interest . using panel data i have anual observations for many countriies . my question is how selecting what sample to use effects the regression analysis . should i only use countries that has introduced the euro ? is adding other european countries or western like countries benefitial as they add more datapoints and/or acts like a reference gropup ? or is id only bad for the data to add countries that has not introduced the euro as they have no variation in the variable of interest ( eurodummy ) ? other comments regarding this problem is also welcome .

what determines a successful protein expression in e. coli ? <eos> some proteins express well in a heterologous host ; others- do n't . a few requirements are known to determine the protein expression , like a strong promoter ( like t7 ) for transcription and a strong ribosome binding site for translation . i am working with a protein , which consists of DIGIT subunits - alpha and beta . both of them are on a plasmid with t7 promoter in front of the beta subunit ( i.e . the construct is t7 promoter , cds for beta subunit , cds for the alpha subunit ) . the beta subunit expresses well , but the alpha does n't . do you thing this has something to do with the local environment ( promoters , rbss , etc ) and how much does it depend on that ? how can i increase the protein expression ?

travelling by train in mainland europe , will i save money by booking my tickets early ? <eos> my wife and i are planning to travel by train from nice to budapest over the course of DIGIT weeks , stopping at a number of towns and cities on the way . we 'd prefer the flexibility of booking our tickets on the day of travel , but are wary of ticket prices rising the closer you get to the travel date ( as happens markedly here in the uk ) . however , do european train ticket prices generally vary in this way , or would a ticket booked on the day cost the same as one booked in advance ? my initial tests on rail europe suggest that the price remains constant , but it would be good to get confirmation from someone more experienced in european train travel . our route is likely to be : nice to verona to salzburg to vienna to budapest .

are composites used by space programs ? <eos> wikipedia says this about the boeing dreamliner : the DIGIT was designed to be the first production airliner with the fuselage assembled with one-piece composite barrel sections instead of the multiple aluminum sheets and some 50,000 fasteners used on existing aircraft . weight is a major problem in space/launch activities . in this context , these questions come to mind : can composites be used by space programs for launch vehicles , the spacecraft itself , or both ? what arguments are there against the use of composites in this context ? e.g . flammable , porous is there any launch vehicle/spacecraft that presently uses composites extensively ?
sustainability of waste incineration vs biofuel/biogas ? <eos> should i encourage my neighbors to send their food waste to a biogas plant instead of the current incineration facility ? i have googled around and it does not seem like it is clear that it is better to produce biogas than to burn waste in a district heat ( i live in cold sweden ) or especially a co generation plant . i would think the high water content of food waste would mean a lot of energy goes to evaporating the water while in a biogas facility maybe more of the energy in the food could be captured ?

how to avoid association of child 's room with time-outs ? <eos> sometimes we send our toddler son to his room , either to calm down or because he has misbehaved and we need some distance . our aim is not primarily the punishment , but rather to have him calm down and/or get him out of our way . this works well and usually everything is fine DIGIT minutes later . we do n't have a `` naughty step '' , `` naughty corner '' or whatever location is often mentioned in such time-out methods . he would n't stay there anyway , but staying in his room works fine . are we creating a negative link between `` time-outs '' and `` his room '' ? how can we avoid that ?

which was that marshall 's game with that spectacular queen sac ? <eos> which was the game where marshall , i think that with black , made a spectacular queen sac in g3 ( white pawns on f2 , g2 , and h2 , king in g1 ) . the black queen could be taken with the f and h pawns and also with a third piece , and all variants led to different checkmate themes . i believe that the audience started throwing gold coins after qg3 was made . update : i changed murphy 's mentions in the original question to mention marshall instead , as marshall was the player who actually did the queen sac .

long-term sustainability concerns of compact flourescent vs incandescent light bulbs <eos> there is a strong movement to push people away from using incandescent lightbulbs in favor of compact flourescent bulbs in order to save energy , but the pollution profiles of these bulbs are very different . incandescents are relatively simple to manufacture , do not involve complex electronics , and do not require mercury vapor and yet they use less energy . my question here is whether it is more sustainable to try to cut energy usage in other ways and stick with incandescent bulbs ( to avoid mercury vapor and needless electronics manufacture ) or to accept the fact that even with the best recycling there is additional heavy metal pollution associated with these newer bulbs ( at very least some will break before reaching the recycling center ) .

cnn : filter kernel size for different features ? <eos> obviously finding suitable hyper-parameters for a neural network is a complex task and very `` problem-/domain-specific '' . however , there should be at least some `` rules '' that hold most times for filter kernel size ? ! in most cases intuition should be to go for small kernel filters for detecting high-frequency features and large kernel fiters for low-frequency features , right ? for example 3x3 kernel filters for edge detection , color contrast stuff , ... and maybe rather something like 11x11 for whole object detection , when the objects are > = 11x11 pixels . is this `` intuition '' more or less generally true ? how can we decide which kernel filter sizes should be chosen for a specific problem - or even for one specific conv layer ?
what is the optimal text width for speed reading ? <eos> was reading here about this technique . from my pov it only works good with a distinct min-max text width . columns in newspapers of a with of a few centimeters ( 5-6 ) seem quite good to me . i also like reading stackexchange sites or google groups with a limited text width/forced linebreaking . old php , vbulletin boards adapt text width to screen width , which makes speed reading on widescreen displays impossible . so what is the correct text min-max range . are there tricks/addons like stylish for firefox URL that can adjust automatically the text width of main body text on websites , blogs , ... via css to the optimal min-max width ? on the stackexchange.com the textwidth is fixed and not changeable by decreasing window size . imo DIGIT of current width would make it more optimal for speed reading .
how do i test if a polygon is monotone with respect to an arbitrary line ? <eos> definition : a polygon $ p $ in the plane is called monotone with respect to a straight line $ l $ , if every line orthogonal to $ l $ intersects $ p $ at most twice . given a polygon $ p $ , is it possible to determine if there exists any line $ l $ such that the polygon $ p $ is monotone with respect to $ l $ ? if yes , how ? previously , i asked a related question ( where i asked how to determine if a polygon is monotone with respect to a particular line ) , but now i am interested in the case when $ l $ is not given or specified in advance .
how does an a330 detect stall without airspeed ? <eos> on air france DIGIT the crew had experienced complete failure of the pitot static system , which meant they lost their readings on their airspeed indicators , but according to the mayday / air crash investigations episode the aircraft had detected that the plane was about to enter an aerodynamic stall and the stall warning systems were activated just before the crash . how did the a330 in question detect that the plane was on the verge of stalling without the airspeed indicators working ?

economic contagion to individual stocks ( ideas for analysis ) <eos> i 'm doing my undergraduate thesis on firm-level contagion . specifically i look at a measure of performance over a financial crisis ( e.g . raw stock returns ) , then run cross-sectional regressions with this response variable upon some regressors that we hypothesise will `` explain '' this performance . i have about DIGIT words left and i am looking for some additional analysis to do . any suggestions are much appreciated . i can handle all the programming and econometrics . i 'm looking for something really original that i can test . all papers seem to stick on this standard question `` what explains individual stocks ' crisis performance '' . this post may be against quant.se 's rules but i was n't sure , so feel free to delete if it is !

web browser password management security <eos> possible duplicate : how are browser saved passwords vulnerable ? how secure are the password managers that are built into modern web browsers ? currently i use lastpass plugin as i believed the browser based password managers were not secure . it is also the solution that i promote when friends and clients ask me about password security . however , i recently noticed that firefox and opera have the ability to set a master password on their stored passwords . i also notice that chrome does not have such a feature ( or am i missing something somewhere . ) are these browser based password managers , with master passwords turned on , any good ? should i continue to advocate lastpass and similar to my friends ? or should i advise them to simply enable the master password option on their browser of choice ?
can knowledge about argumentation be sufficient for philosophical logic without too symbolic or mathematical concepts ? <eos> the most important element for expression of truth is trough an argument , with premises and conclusion . argumentation requires to avoid fallacies and adhere to the truth . however logic if treated as a subject itself and not a part of something else grows bigger and deeper , that it leads to symbols which i find unnecessary for philosophical usage of asserting an existential claim or in other words it turns to mathematical than philosophical , take for example the concepts of propositional and other forms of modern logic with terms and functions to obscure to be used for philosophical assertions . so can the basic knowledge about argumentation , fallacies , and adherence to truth be sufficient for philosophical logic or philosophical purposes without too symbolic or mathematical concepts ?
my guitar goes out of tune at a higher pitch rather than lower , is that normal ? <eos> it is my understanding that strings , over time , stretch and are unable to maintain their tension , so they go out of tune at a lower pitch . when i pick up my guitar and i tune it with my electronic tuner , i often find most strings at a higher pitch than they should be ... this means that they have gained tension ... how is this possible ? this has happened to me with two different guitars in two different houses and over a sizeable period of time ( months ) , so i 'm starting to suspect that i 'm doing something wrong .

why would you ever allow an opponent to score ? <eos> watching super bowl xlvi , i noticed near the end of the game the new england patriots allowed the new york giants to score a touchdown uncontested . at this point in the game , the patriots were winning with only a few seconds left in the game , but instead of trying to prevent the giants from scoring , they allowed them to score and ended up losing the game . why would a coach make this decision that would put his team in a position where they would most likely not be able to win ?
the product of two riemann integrable functions is integrable <eos> the goal is to show that the product of two riemann integrable functions is integrable . first step is to use the identity $ fcdot g = frac { 1 } { 4 } left [ ( f+g ) ^2 - ( f-g ) ^2right ] $ so that we only need to consider squares of functions . the second step is to reduce to positive valued functions because $ f ( x ) ^2=left|f ( x ) right|^2 $ . the third step is to use that if $ 0 leq f ( x ) leq m $ on $ left [ a , bright ] $ , $ $ f^2 ( x ) - f^2 ( y ) leq 2m left ( , f ( x ) -f ( y ) right ) $ $ how should i go about implementing the above steps ?

e-readers for office library instead of hard copies ? <eos> in my department , we are floating the idea of replacing our library with a few e-readers as often a handful of people will be researching a particular concept at the same time and sharing books becomes an issue . this was originally cited as cost prohibitive , but it was proven that even if we have one e-reader for every three employees , it is no more expensive in the long run than physical copies . for anyone out there who has tried this , if we make the switch , is there one single factor that would cause us to decide to go back to a hard copy library ? note : i 'm only interested in the concept of sharing e-readers in an office as opposed to the general advantages/disadvantages of e-readers for an individual .

why is losing a limb different from shaving ? <eos> if someone loses a limb and the limb is hypothetically moved to a different country , i think most people will agree that the limb is still `` part of '' the body ( i.e. , `` owned by '' that person ) , even though the body is now in two pieces . but if someone shaves hair off his/her body and we move the hair to a different country , i think most people will agree that the hair is no longer `` part of '' the body , even though something that was once part of that body is no longer attached to it . so why really is that ? how do we decide what parts of an entity inherently change that entity if they were removed ?

what view of marriage is presented in jude the obscure ? <eos> thomas hardy 's gut-wrenching tragedy jude the obscure includes a lot of discussion of the concept of marriage , from various different characters , some of whose views even change over the course of the novel . in some ways , married relationships are portrayed as unloving and unsuccessful ( jude and arabella , sue and mr phillotson ) , in contrast to the 'freer ' nature of a non-marital relationship . on the other hand , jude and sue face many difficulties due to being unmarried , and perhaps their lives would have ended up better if they had got married . is there any consistent underlying message here ? overall , what view of marriage does jude the obscure promote - positive or negative ?

why is lanthanum a `` fluoride ion sensitive electrode '' and hence used for measuring `` flouride concentration '' ? <eos> my chemistry text book says that `` atomic absorption spectrometry ( aas ) can be used to determine the concentration of metal ions , but other methods must be used for anions . one convenient method is to use an ion-selective electrode ( ise ) . '' what is the reason ? why ca n't asp be used for determining the concentration of anions ? the author then argues that `` lanthanum fluoride crystal doped with europium '' is the element used for measuring the concentration of fluorine in water because `` fluoride ions bind to the crystal '' . what is the reason behind choosing `` lanthanum doped with europium '' ?
special texture stretching without deformation <eos> i am trying to achieve a special texture stretching effect in my shader . here is how i define my uv before sampling my texture , nothing really special . // uv_st contains the tiling and offset values uv.xy = uv.xy * uv_st.xy + uv_st.zw this gives the standard tiling/stretching and offset behaviour when you tile/stretche a clamped texture as you can see in the image below . first is normal , second is offset and last is stretching . but i want to avoid the deformation behaviour when stretching , i want to keep margins when stretching my texture or simply cut it in the middle and stretching it . here is an illustration below . how could i do that inside my shader when defining my uvs before sampling the texture ?

pneumatic actuators - system reversibility . is it possible to use an actuator to store energy ? <eos> i 'm very much new to pneumatics and i was wondering if there was such a thing as a reversible pneumatic actuator ? i 'm designing a system that has to be lightweight , pneumatic and use a mechanical input to store energy in a pneumatic manner . the system must then be able to translate this energy back to kinetic energy . from my research i have found that there are no pneumatic motors that can be back-driven to run as a compressor , and the addition of a compressor adds weight to the system so i 'm trying to avoid this . essentially , i was wondering if i used a generator/motor to convert the mechanical input to electrical energy , would an actuator have the ability to convert electrical energy into a source of potential energy ?
are there any untoward synergistic effects in taking a combination of acetaminophen plus ibuprofen ? <eos> a number of years ago , it became popular to advocate a combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen ( or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication ) at the usual higher doses ( e.g . 1,000mg acetaminophen plus 400mg ibuprofen* ) because studies had shown increased efficacy over either medication alone in pain relief . in fact , i believe in europe there are over-the-counter products that combine the two . my question : does the combination of the two medications taken together have increased risks above the combined risks of the individual medications ? if so , is the mechanism of the untoward synergistic effect known ? *dosage based on studies showing that higher doses of ibuprofen were no better at pain relief than DIGIT mg/day .

why did the shadows eliminate the narn psychics ? <eos> in babylon 5 , g'kar says that there are no narn psychics because the shadows killed them a thousand years ago during the last war . their stated reason for doing this is that the shadows ' ships are vulnerable to psychics . however , it 's established that the reason the shadows cause all the strife in the first place is to create war and conflict in order to purge the weak , accelerating evolution for the victorious . it seems strange then that the shadows would specifically target more powerful , more highly evolved bloodlines such as those of the narn psychics . so why did the shadows kill them ?

are there other pairs of languages that are as close grammatically despite not being in the same language family as korean and japanese ? <eos> though there are many theories grouping korean and japanese in the same family , none of these are widely accepted by linguists . yet the grammars of these two languages are extremely similar in many ways : topic + comment word order use of particles agglutinative verb morphology but simple noun morphology two kinds of adjectives : noun-like and verb-like no definite or definite articles , no distinction between singular and plural , use of counters complex honorifics systems are there other cases where two languages not considered by most linguists to be in the same family are grammatically similar to such a degree , or are these two languages special ?
how does cerebrospinal fluid circulate in the central nervous system ? <eos> cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) is produced in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles and in the 4th ventricle of the brain . csf then circulates through the ventricles of the brain and the subarachnoid space of the meninges . csf is returned to the venous system via the arachnoid granulations connecting the subrachnoid space with the superior sagittal sinus at the superior portion of the neurocranium . what circulates the csf such that it can return to the venous system against gravity ? in other words , why does csf not all just pool in the caudal cistern ?

is there always at most one full-support extreme symmetric equilibrium ? <eos> given a ( $ n $ -player ) symmetric game and two equilibriums $ s_1 , s_2 $ , is it true that if the support ( the set of strategies with positive probabilities ) of $ s_1 $ is identical to the support of $ s_2 $ then $ frac { s_1+s_2 } { 2 } $ is also a symmetric equilibrium ? by $ frac { s_1+s_2 } { 2 } $ i mean that a strategy $ i $ will be selected by a player with a probability which equals the average of the probability of $ i $ under $ s_1 $ and the probability of $ i $ under $ s_2 $ .

is duration really the slope of the price-yield curve ? <eos> when looking at the price-vs-yield graph for a fixed rate instrument , we are often told that the duration is the slope of that curve . but is that really right ? duration is ( change in price ) divided by ( price times change in yield ) . that 's hardly the slope of the curve which would be ( change in price ) divided by ( change in yield ) . yield is expressed in percentage terms which makes it look relative , but going from DIGIT to DIGIT is a relative increase of 100 % , because it 's a DIGIT increase only in absolute terms . that added factor of price is not constant and so the slope and duration differ by different ratios for different prices ! ?

do xafs excitations and subsequent relaxations lead to vibrationally hot molecules ? <eos> i 'm in the process of trying to understand x-ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) spectroscopy , but i think this question is more fundamental than merely as it pertains to xafs . i think i do n't entirely understand the interplay between electronic , vibrational , and rotational excitations in molecules . i understand that vibrational fine structure can be seen in electronic spectra . but how do we know which vibrational state a transition will end up in ? is it a boltzmann distribution ? so to my main question . i realize that on the energy scale of xafs , vibrational energy levels are not resolved ; i just want to know if these transitions lead to the same type of vibrational state distribution that valence electronic transitions yield . is that the case ? or if not , why not ?

thickness on flat surfaces <eos> does anyone have good suggestion for how to achieve “ thickness ” on flat polygons at render time ? it would be the same as extruding a flat polygon just slightly . for sprites with opacity masks , this should prevent them from vanishing at extreme angles . actually extruding a sprite would require a lot of geometry , at least compared to just defining its contour with an opacity map , so having a cheap technique that attributes a minimal amount of thickness to flat surfaces would save a lot of effort/memory in many use-cases ( leafs , snowflakes , paper , plastic-films , etc.. ) .

why must a toddler car seat be fully reclined when installed rear-facing ? <eos> our daughter has been in an infant seat since birth , but is now 16lbs , and very near the height limit for this seat . we have received a nearly-new convertible seat from friends , but have a few questions about installing it in our compact car . the documentation ( linked below ) indicates that the seat may only be used rear-facing in its most fully-reclined position ( of three ) . what is the rationale for this instruction ? the back seat of our yaris can not accommodate the seat fully reclined , however it fits without a problem in the middle and upright positions . i can understand the seat needing to be fully reclined to accommodate an infant without proper head control , but our child is nearly walking ! the seat in question is the alpha omega elite .

what does the vix formula measure and how does it work ? <eos> i have read the cboe 's white paper on the vix and a lot of other things , but i need to honestly say , i do n't really get it , or i am missing something important . in semi-layman 's terms , is the vix simply the a measurement of the volume of protective options bought ? that is , individual contract volatility increases when the option has been bid up by buyers due to desirability . one contract alone only marginally increases the overall market volatility , but if all contracts were bid up , then the entire vix would be recalculated ( on the fly ) to reflect the higher value of protective options as a speculative/hedge solution . do i understand this correctly , or do i really need to put more time into understanding that formula which comprises the vix ?

why do we grow so much hair on our heads compared to our bodies ? <eos> i 've been wondering about head hair , facial hair in particular . human males can grow very extensive beards should they choose to not shave - however you do not really see this in our chimpanzee cousins ! yes , they have little pseudo-beards , but the difference being that they do not shave , that is just the length they reach . whereas in humans we can grow to our hearts content ( *this may not be the case , see this question ) . i ca n't really see why this would have been selected , unless it 's simply that ( evolutionarily speaking ) women like men with long beards ? so my question is : why can humans perpetually grow head hair , yet we have lost the majority of our body hair , in comparison to chimpanzees and other ape family members ?

how does notch 's new graphics engine work ? <eos> @ notch has recently been posting on an engine he is developing . he claims that it is voxel-based and supports deformable terrain , with a render distance of almost DIGIT DIGIT voxels and real-time reflections , running at 99fps in webgl . even with heavy lod reduction , such a thing sounds too good to be true . he has not published any source code as of now , so does anyone have an idea how this is done ? is it just many small optimizations or could this be a new approach to real time 3d ? edit : he also mentions a `` signed density field '' . what does that mean exactly ?
why is `` blue '' a traditional dog 's name ? <eos> i think of `` blue '' as a classic name for a bloodhound or big farm/country dog , but i ca n't think of why that might be . a quick search did n't turn up much for me , and i am curious how this name would have originated . i know that some dogs can have blue eyes ( e.g . huskies ) but i do n't think that is the case for the types of dogs that would ( traditionally at least ) be called blue .

trickle-charging batteries for outdoor usage/ wind turbine suggestions <eos> i have a shimano hub dynamo wheel from an old bike , i intend on turning into a small wind-turbine , probably starting off like this but being modded further when i have the time . my modest aim is to charge a battery for a light in my shed ( i am unsure what i can expect to get from such a turbine ) . what is a good option for a trickle charging unit , ideally one which wo n't mind a bit of frost , and wo n't cost the earth . is there something i can re-purpose ? i am not afraid of soldering . the closest thing i have found to what i want is a thinkbiologic reecharge for ~£25 presumably the `` 1600 mah lithium-polymer battery '' would be ok if suitably insulated ? is there a more conventional solution ?

is herpes simplex/cold sore on the thigh considered a sexually transmitted disease ? <eos> when i was a kid i got a cold sore / herpes simplex ( 1 , i think ) on the thigh . as far as i know , i have n't had any cold sores on the actual genital area , and it 's been a while . i wonder if this is considered a genital herpes infection ( on account of it being physically close ) and thus an sti , or is it just exactly like a cold sore in the mouth ? i wonder if i should be worried and take additional care . i guess that sounds like a diagnosis question , but i 'm genuinely curious how it is classified and the involved risks . thanks !
tracking with accelerometer and gyro versus multiple accelerometers <eos> i 'm building quadcopter and most of the control systems use one accelerometer and gyro . i 've read few papers and usually accelerometer is used as reference to the ground because gyro slowly drifts away in time . but if quadcopter does some crazy maneuvering when force direction from accelerometer does not have to point to the ground than accelerometer data is useless . as well there is problem with centripetal force if the accelerometer is not directly in the centor of mass . i was thinking about using multiple accelerometers . to fully determine position and motion of quadcopter one would need three accelerometers ( if i have done the math right ) . this would kind of solve the problem with centripetal force so i would like to know if anyone tried to use multiple accelerometers for better orientation estimation .

approaching vendors to advertise on my site <eos> i have built a website that will be a directory for a niche of schools . there is a page that will list them by region and each will link to their own website . i discovered that there was n't a list of all these schools and as i was learning to code thought it would be a good challenge . what i was wondering is if i am in a position to charge the school a fee to be listed - and if so how much is reasonable . i 'm based in the uk . the site is yet to be hosted so i obviously have no hits but the niche is large . the other thing i was considering is to sell a related ebook on the site .

has earth ever sent out a repeating signal into space ? <eos> my understanding is that for us to confirm that a signal is of artificial origin , we have to get the same signal at least twice . however , as far as i can tell , most of the signals we 've sent out to contact extraterrestrials have only been sent once , and thus any extraterrestrial civilizations receiving them would likely dismiss them . so , have we ever sent a signal at least twice , to make sure that anyone receiving it would realize it is of artificial origin ?

are broiler chickens raised in `` chicken tractors '' less likely to get hock burn ? <eos> there is a discussion on the james oliver site asking if a free-range bird can have hock burns . there are statements that a free-range chicken could develop hock burn due to exposure to mud . a chicken tractor ( sometimes called an ark ) is a movable chicken coop lacking a floor . by moving it to fresh pasture daily the chickens would not be exposed to bare earth plus all the chicken tractors that i 've seen include shelter from rain , wind and other weather . is this likely to reduce the chance of hock burn ?

what is the relationship between the hodge dual of p-vectors and the dual space of an ordinary vector space ? <eos> i understand what the hodge dual is , but i ca n't quite wrap my head around the dual space of vector space . they seem very similar , almost the same , but perhaps they are unrelated . for instance , in $ mathbb { r } ^3 $ , the blade $ a wedge b $ gives you a subspace that 's like a plane , and the dual is roughly the normal to the plane . is there a similarly simple example for the dual space of a vector space , or is there a way to describe the vector space dual in terms of the hodge dual ?

meaning of lagrange multiplier always being 0 ? <eos> i 'm optimizing a family of objectives over $ x_1 , ldots , x_n $ with a single constraint that $ x $ 's add up to $ 1 $ , and when using method of lagrange multipliers , the single multiplier always ends up $ 0 $ for members of this family ... does this tell us anything interesting about these objectives ? edit : the answer was -- it means the constraint it inactive , ie , removing the constraint does n't change the answer of optimization problem
why does the cart move ? <eos> a while ago someone proposed the following thought experiment to me : a horse attached to a cart is resting on a horizontal road . if the horse attempts to move by pulling the cart , according to the 3rd newton 's law , the cart will exert a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction , cancelling each other out and thus the horse and the cart should not move . and yet it moves ( pun intended ; ) why ? i never got a satisfactory answer , my guess is that the answer lies in the frames of reference involved : horse-cart and horse-road . any ideas ?

is the symmetric equiblirium in congesstion games always inferior in terms of social-welfare ? <eos> let $ g $ be a finite , symmetric , congestion game . according to nash theorem , a ( mixed ) symmetric equilibrium surely exists . congestion games also known to admit pure-strategies nash equilibrium as they are exact potential games . i was wondering if a symmetric ( i.e . one in which all players play a strategy with the same probability ) can yield higher social-welfare ( sum of payoffs for the players ) than any other equilibrium for the game . the intuition is that if all players are using the same elements , this has to incur higher cost than if they partition across multiple actions , as the payoff per player depends directly on the number of players using the same elements . also , is there always a single symmetric equilibrium for congestion games ?
london on public transport : what kind of tickets to use ? <eos> i 'm visiting london for a couple of days , and planning to use public transport while there . what kind of ticket ( s ) would it make most sense to use ? do i get the most value out of single tickets , day travelcards , an oyster card , or something else ? ( i 'm guessing the oyster card is more geared towards residents of london , but i 'm not sure . ) i 'd mostly move around in central london ( within zone 1 ) with accommodation being located a little further away ( zone 2 ) . most probably i 'd take several trips each day ( some of which might be during rush hour ) . bonus question : while i would surely be using the tube the most , are the same tickets generally valid for buses too ?

has declaring an official language ever tangibly benefited a country ? <eos> in the united states , some feel very strongly that english should be declared the official language . one of the arguments in favor of this is that a common language is a powerful common ground that binds people together . québec is cited as an example , since they speak french in an english-speaking country and have enough dissension to consider seceding . so , is there an example of a country that declared an official language and saw positive benefits as a result ?
algorithms computing if a number is a multiple of DIGIT <eos> when doing mental calculus one can do : given an integer k , sum all the digits ( in base 10 ) , and if the result is a multiple of 3 , then k is a multiple of DIGIT do you know of any algorithm working similarily but operating on binary numbers digits ( bits ) ? at first , i was thinking of using the ready made functions of my language converting integer to ascii to perform the convertion from base DIGIT to base 10 , then apply the mental calculus trick . but of course then i could also encode the base convertion DIGIT to DIGIT myself . i have not done it yet , but i 'll give it a try . then i have thought of euclidian division in base 2 ... however i wonder if there are other means , algorithms .

do referendums lead to significantly different decisions than when decisions are taken by parliament ? <eos> one argument that is used against decision-making by popular referendum is that they tend to lead to populist , perhaps even impossible decisions . it seems that referendums can lead to decisions that corresponding legislations would not take . the swiss minaret ban from DIGIT is a ( n ) ( in ) famous example . in a swiss referendum in 1989 , more than DIGIT voted in favour of abolishing the army ; although not near a majority , it was accepted in two cantons , and in parliament this idea would not have gotten such a high percentage . has there been any systematic study to test whether referendums lead to significantly different decisions than when all decisions are taken by elected parliamentarians ? the term populist is probably quite subjective , but would such decisions be likely to be considered populist ?

n balls and a scale <eos> the question of twelve balls and a scale is probably the best-known example of the `` find the ball of a different weight '' problem . but does it generalize ? is there a general way to find a weighing algorithm for $ n $ balls on a scale where $ n ne 12 $ ? this is the variant where the direction of deviation is not known ( one ball is slightly lighter or slightly heavier than the others ) and the solution must both pinpoint the odd ball and indicate whether it is lighter or heavier . assume that for $ k $ weighings , there will be no more than $ ( 3^k - 3 ) / 2 $ balls to weigh , as that has been proven to be optimum .

how do you determine ekf process noise for pre-recorded data sets ? <eos> i 've seen this question , which asks about determining the process noise for an ekf . i do n't see anything there about pre-recorded data sets . my thought on how to determine the noise parameters , assuming ground truth is available , would be to run the data several times with the ekf and minimize the mean square error , while varying the noise parameters . is this an acceptable way to determine noise for a pre recorded data set ? are there better ( or just other ) ways from determining the optimal noise values based just on the data set ?

table image when playing with fish . <eos> when at a poker table with players who are not particularly advanced ( i usually play smaller home game tournaments ) , i am confronted with an issue . namely , how to project my table image in this situation . i have three options : do i go straight to shuffling my chips , talking about the wsop main event final from three years ago and talk about poker terms that i know nobody else at the table understands to scare them ? do i act as if i have very little poker knowledge and let these people think they can bully me ? do i not focus on this aspect of the game at all , as players at this level may not factor this into their playing strategy at all ? what is the best way to play this and why ?

( why ) is there more landmass on earth 's northern hemisphere than the southern hemisphere ? <eos> this question on worldbuilding is based on the presumption that there is a greater amount of landmass on the earth 's northern hemisphere than there is on the southern hemisphere . while researching to form an answer to this question , i found it difficult to find a map that accurately portrays which hemisphere actually has a greater landmass , and started thinking about the actual nature of the question - assuming there is a greater concentration of landmass in the northern hemisphere than the south , why is that ? does it have anything to do with the rotational procession of the earth ? is it more related to the earth 's natural fault lines ? or is there something else that influences a greater accumulation of land mass on our northern hemisphere ( if that is , in fact , an accurate assumption ) ?

individual/casual investors and the bias towards blue-chip stocks ? <eos> there 's quite a bit of research ( example , [ 1 ] ) teasing out the fact that home/casual/individual investors prefer stocks with large positive skewness . it surprised me , as i was reading a bunch of these papers , that no point is made about whether casual investors like to hold stocks with high visibility characteristics ( e.g . well known in news , large size , `` safe '' , `` blue chip '' stocks ) . my expectation is that there is a bias towards large stocks ... just going off people in my family , but i would like to see a study of this . question : are you aware of any empirical study that addresses this question ?

help determining virtual geomagnetic pole <eos> magnetic measurements have been made on some lavas found at 60ºn and 90ºw . the inclination angle is 37º . if the horizontal direction of magnetism of these lavas is due west , calculate the position of earth 's magnetic pole when these lavas errupted . i found the magnetic latitude using $ arctan ( frac { 1 } { 2 } tan ( 37^ { circ } ) ) = 20.6^ { circ } $ , but i 'm not sure how to get the pole location since we are not given declination angle . i think you use this formula : $ costheta_p = costheta_s costheta_m + sintheta_s sintheta_m cos d $ but not sure how without declination angle d .

checking anova assumptions <eos> a few months ago i posted a question about homoscedasticity tests in r on so , and ian fellows answered that ( i 'll paraphrase his answer very loosely ) : homoscedasticity tests are not a good tool when testing the goodness of fit of your model . with small samples , you do n't have enough power to detect departures from homoscedasticity , while with big samples you have `` plenty of power '' , so you are more likely to screen even trivial departures from equality . his great answer came as a slap in my face . i used to check normality and homoscedasticity assumptions each time i ran anova . what is , in your opinion , best practice when checking anova assumptions ?

is mathematics infinitely regressive ? <eos> agrippas trilemma states that formal systems are either self-circular , infinitely regressive or axiomatic . its commonly taken that mathematics is axiomatic . however just as mathematicians can build ever more elaborate structures , they can painstakingly dig-down into foundations . does this mean that mathematics is actually infinitely regressive , it 's just that the diggig is a bit slow ? after ymars comment , i emphasise i mean formalistically . ( from another perspective mathematics is what mathematicians trained at certain schools do ; similarly to some contemporary description of art by critics , art is something that artists trained at certain schools do . but one could argue here , the critics have just thrown in the towel . )

animating falling object <eos> i 'm playing around with opengl . i wrote a small program to simulate a falling object . my code looks like the following : static glfloat last = glfwgettime ( ) ; glfloat now = glfwgettime ( ) ; glfloat delta = now - last ; const glfloat g = -9.8 ; velocity += g * delta ; distance += velocity * delta ; now for some reason the object falls really slowly . however , if i remove the * delta from the last line distance += velocity ; the simulation appears correct . but if g = acceleration = $ m/s^2 $ then g * delta = $ m/s $ = velocity . then velocity * delta = $ m $ , right ? where did i go wrong ?

what 's the physicochemical difference between a chromophore and a fluorophore ? <eos> let 's take hematoxylin , which is a ph indicator and a stain for histology , and therefore a chromophore , but does not fluoresce : now let 's take eosin , which stains tissue pinkish , but is also fluorescent : i would like to know which features of the molecules decide if it is a chromophore or a fluorophore . as far as i can see it ( i 'm a biologist with some training in organic chemistry ) , both have conjugated systems , although the system in eosin spans a lot of more bonds . is it really just the size of the conjugated system that decides this , e.g. , if hematoxylin had a larger conjugated system , would it also be fluorescent ?

significance of life in bhagavad gītā <eos> i 'm watching lectures of prof. jay l. garfield named `` meaning of life : perspectives from the world ’ s great intellectual traditions '' . the first three lectures are discussing bhagavad gita . two ideas ( among others ) i 've learnt from those lectures are : each life is significant ( `` each life has its place '' ) everyone has their duty ( svadharma ) it remains unclear to me how they treat people who do not act according to their svadharma . does bhagavad gita teach us to assume that everyone else respects their duty and acts properly ? without that assumption there seems to be a contradiction , because someone can act against the cosmic order and still be a part of that order .

why is it that poverty incidence is high in the agricultural sector ? <eos> i read this article earlier , and the `` experts '' there say : `` the incidence of poverty is very high in agriculture because of its low productivity . '' `` the incidence of poverty is very high in agriculture because of its relatively slow growth . '' but why do they say that ? how about you ? what do you think is the cause ? to me , they keep saying that : `` [ t ] he share of agriculture in gdp , and not the demand for agriculture per se , which declines as income per capita increases '' but why would you want to be more productive/produce more goods when people in general are going to have a pretty much similar demand for the product ( 'cause it says there that demand for agri products do n't necessarily decline ) ?

where are log files located on android ? <eos> possible duplicate : how can i view and examine the android log ? my android ( 2.1 ) phone ( a htc wildfire , if that matters ) sometimes reboots without an apparent reason . not extremely frequently , but too much to simply ignore it . i 'd say once every couple of days . it always happens when i 'm not using the phone , i take it out of my pocket and am greeted by the sim unlock screen , so it 's hard to pinpoint the app or service that is causing it . i browsed the filesystem a bit but could n't immediately find anything like /var/log , so i wonder if anyone knows where logfiles are located , if they exist at all ? or any other way to easily pinpoint the offending process on my phone ?

will ai develop in hybrid ways ? <eos> there are two general ways in which ai can interact with humans : implants of ai devices into human bodies or brains & mdash ; such implantation has already begun with health monitors and could grow to include cognitive access to general purpose digital computing . once such is accepted , it is possible that humans will emerge with behavior largely defined by its implants therefore qualify as a hybrid ai systems . embedding of ai systems into business or government organizations & mdash ; it is possibliites that the behavior of organizations using ai systems for business decisioning will eventually be defined in behavior largely by those systems and would therefore qualify as a hybrid ai systems . how probable are these possibilities , considering human history and current cultural trends in technology acceptance ?

factor scores from discrete , ordinal responses <eos> is there a principled way to estimate factor scores when you have ordinal , discrete variables . i have $ n $ ordinal , discrete , variables . if i make the assumption that underlying each response is a continuous , normally distributed variable , then i can calculate an $ ntimes n $ polychoric correlation matrix . i can then run a factor analysis on this matrix and get factor loadings for each variable . how can i combine the factor loadings and the variables to estimate the factor scores . the typical ways to estimate scores would appear to require that i treat the ordinal data as interval . i suppose i might need to dig deeper into the guts of polychoric correlation to figure out a link function .

logic for a knowledge based expert system <eos> basically , i want a system that reads blobs of text , parses it and stores related chunks and when the user asks a question , it returns with an in-context answer which groups together a bunch of facts . the topic and the initial blob set is hardcoded . i am noober than a newbie and i do n't understand how the chunks would form relationships amongst themselves by logic and not by rule when the inference engine would run and also , how they would be stored together . also , if i am trying to reinvent the wheel , i 'd be grateful if you could point me to open-source systems that already exist which just take in data and produce answers to questions after having performed some logical operations on it . thanks in advance .

how does the amount of mass in an atmosphere affect the seasonal changes and dynamics of the planet 's climate ? <eos> i was thinking about this question , which may turn out to be simple , about climate dynamics : how does the amount of mass in an atmosphere affect the seasonal changes and dynamics of the planet 's climate ? for example , while i know there are seasons on mars , there surely is n't as stark of shift between seasons like earth for example . perhaps the amount of mass in the atmosphere really is n't a controlling variable ? perhaps composition or even distance to external heat sources is more important ?

can i use bitcoin mining as a data furnace to heat my home ? <eos> one of the waste products from bitcoin mining is the heat that is given off by the gpus . on cold days could this excess heat be used to warm a home , essentially creating a data furnace ? when it gets warmer then the rig can be optionally shut down . as i understand it , the income generated from mining bitcoins at least pays for the electricity so long as you have a rig that is capable of meeting the difficulty . this would therefore imply that so long as you have already got a suitable rig lying around the house ( e.g . for gaming ) then running it up during the day would be useful . if the house also had solar panels then that would also benefit the earning potential . are there any calculations available to support/refute this ?

how can i make back to my mac screen sharing go full screen ? <eos> i 've got two macs , both with the same monitor . when i use back to my mac screen sharing from mac a to mac b , i see the full screen of mac b , but it 's in a window on mac a , and the image is scaled a little bit . also , since i set up all my machines the same way , the dock is on the bottom and has auto hide enabled for both . when i try to expose my doc on mac b , my cursor winds up leaving the window and exposing the dock on mac a. is there any way to get that screen sharing window to go full screen , the way something like vmware or parallels does ? i tried other vnc clients , but apple 's screen sharing is the most responsive .
why is $ \rho_m $ proportional to the deviation from critical temperature in critical phenomena ? <eos> in peskin and schroeder 's chapter DIGIT about the renormalization group , it is stated that the parameter $ rho_m=m^2/m^2 $ , where $ m $ is the mass and $ m $ is the renormalization scale , is proportional to $ t-t_c $ . but this assertion is not derived in any detail , except for a handwaving one-line explanation `` $ rho_m $ is just the parameter that one adjust finely to bring the system to the critical temperature '' . could someone elaborate this ? in particular , why does n't the parameter depend on the square or some other power of $ t-t_c $ ?

why is minimum pressure specified on a psu water cooling circuit ? <eos> i work in consultancy and i am designing a product for a customer . the customer has requested a specific psu . i have contacted this psu manufacturer and they request DIGIT l/min of coolant flow and minimum DIGIT bar . i now have to specify a suitable pump to deliver these fluid characteristics to the psu . i have confirmed this is not a typo for `` maximum pressure , '' but no reasoning for specifying a minimum pressure is forthcoming . my confusion is why the flow rate and minimum pressure are specified . the manufacturer does not know what pressure differential i require to generate the specified flow around my bespoke circuit - so why specify a minimum pressure and a flow rate ?
meaning of `` a lady with apologies abounds '' in byron 's don juan <eos> from byron 's don juan : julia , in fact , had tolerable grounds , — alfonso 's loves with inez were well known , but whether 't was that one 's own guilt confounds— but that ca n't be , as has been often shown , a lady with apologies abounds ; — it might be that her silence sprang alone from delicacy to don juan 's ear , to whom she knew his mother 's fame was dear . i do n't understand `` a lady with apologies abounds '' = `` a lady is full of apologies '' , i.e . a lady usually apologizes a lot ? but that does not seem to fit the overall meaning ; she is acting brazenly here .

are there endgames which could be forced wins if not for the 50-move rule ? <eos> wikipedia 's article on the fifty-move rule states : in the 20th century it was discovered that some positions of certain endgames can only be won in more than fifty moves ( without a capture or a pawn move ) . the rule was changed to include certain exceptions in which one hundred moves were allowed with particular material combinations . however , more and more exceptions were discovered and in DIGIT fide abolished all such exceptions and reinstated the strict fifty-move rule . i have never seen an example of this , though i used to think the k , n , b vs. k ending was one . when is it possible to force a win in DIGIT moves or more , but not less than DIGIT moves ?

turning left over broth from a roast into a soup or stew <eos> two nights ago , i made a roast . not wanting to waste anything i kept most of the left over beef broth ( about DIGIT cups ) . my current idea is to turn this beef broth into a soup or a stew . here 's what i was thinking : skim the fat chucks off the top of the broth ( left there by the roast ) for a stew i would add in carrots , celery , onions , garlic , and use a potato to naturally thicken the broth as it cooks . for a soup , i would probably just add the vegetables mentioned above minus the potato and then thicken a bit with some cornstarch . is this the best way to go about it ? is this a good use of the left over broth ?
freezing fingers and toes <eos> when i work outside in near zero degree temps and mittens or gloves are too cumbersome to work with my fingers get so cold they ache . my toes may get cold and ache as well depending on how long i 'm outside and if moister wicking socks are worn . my question is not on prevention . common sense helps most of the time . i 've found that applying dry heat can bring your extremities back to normal quite effectively ; hair dryer or wood stove etc . but why if you put your toes or fingers under even luke warm water to below `` hot to the touch '' water can bring on excruciating pain . similar to hitting your fingers/thumb with a hammer . just wondering why ?

what time of year to mulch/feed trees ? <eos> this answer recommends putting down a layer of compost mulch in the fall in order to slowly feed the tree . ( in addition to the unmentioned weed control and moisture regulation . ) it makes sense to me -- i was ready to go out and spread compost around my apple , peach , and maple trees a couple of weeks ago until i did some reading that suggested i should wait until april . the advice in books and elsewhere said that we should feed/mulch trees in spring in order to prevent stimulating new growth just before cold weather ( to avoid winter kill ) . in addition , they caution against mulching heading into winter to avoid providing a home for mice or voles . which is correct ? is a late fall feeding really going to stimulate any growth ?

predators faking to be not hungry ? <eos> i believe that there are predator/prey combinations where the prey can easily spot that the predator is not hungry and will not try to flee from it . i ’ m thinking , for example , of gazelles who will happily graze in sight of sleeping lions . ( please correct me if this is already wrong . ) it seems to be sensible ( in an evolutionary sense ) for the predator to not put unnecessary stress on the prey . first question : are there predator who actively signal that they are not hungry , e.g . by a certain sound ? and my second question : is there such a combination where the predator will , in times of severe hunger , pretend not to be hungry in order to more easily catch a prey ?

( the goal here is aural feedback of touch interactions , not the creation of super-detailed sound effects . )

what did sgt . bilko & co. have against oats ? <eos> in one episode of the phil silvers show ( aka sgt . bilko ) , bilko buys a racehorse and wants to get rich by sponsoring him at the races . of course , they had to feed the horse , and a fair amount of the comedy of the episode was based on the premise that all the men thought that oats were disgusting and only fit for horse food . today that seems very strange ; they 're a well-loved staple in america and elsewhere . and that 's hardly a new cultural phenomenon , since oats have been grown as food for both man and livestock for thousands of years . so why , on a tv show from the 1950s , was the contemporary audience expected to find the characters ' discomfort at having to eat oats funny ?

jacobian transpose : how to calculate orientation error <eos> i 'm confused about how to compute the error in orientation . all the documents i 've read do n't explain how to do it . the error in position is simply the difference between the points . let 's assume we have the orientation along the effector axis , and we represent the rotation with quaternions . i have two questions : is describing the orientation with quaternions a good approach ? how can we compute the error in orientation with the quaternions to use this in jacobian transpose ?

when are ( american ) football teams likely to decline penalties ? <eos> in the first quarter of the super bowl , the seahawks threw an incomplete pass on first down , leading to second down . except that the offense had a `` false start , '' for a five yard penalty . the broncos accepted it , and it was first and DIGIT instead of second and DIGIT why would the broncos prefer the extra five yards instead of declining the penalty for a loss of a down ? my understanding is that fewer opportunities for `` conversion '' often outweighs the distance . unless the penalty decision was governed by field position ? the seahawks started from the broncos 30 , and were pulled back to the 35 , toward the edge of field goal range .

how to react to `` cruelty '' of a toddler ? <eos> my son is two and a half years old and is not in general of the violent type . however he regularly enjoys showing `` cruelty '' . by that i mean that regularly when he `` by accident '' ( let 's stay positive ) hits someone or some stuffed animal and we tell him that he should n't do it , or to be careful because it hurts , he just laughs and starts doing it even more . this never escalates very far since we do n't let him continue for long , but it still worries me that he seems to enjoy so much somebody else 's pain . any suggestions ?

how to interpret half notes combined with thirty-second stems ? <eos> i want to play also sprach zarathustra ( imslp pdf ) , but there is something i do n't understand there . in the first few bars there are DIGIT half notes beamed in pairs as thirty-second notes . because the time signature is common time i deduce each of those `` hybrid '' notes is equal to a quarter note . am i correct ? if so does the math add up ? in addition in the 6th bar in the second and third thirty-second notes beams are `` broken . '' why is that ?
is gasoline or diesel refining less sustainable , per energy output ? <eos> inspired by my own answer here , i 'm wondering what the actual numbers are regarding gasoline and diesel fuel refining . i have read ( do n't remember where ) that refining of diesel fuel is less environmentally damaging than that of gasoline . but is this actually true ? and for the sake of this question , i 'm interested in the environmental impact of refining per energy output ( not per volume of fuel ) , so the energy density of the output fuel ought to be considered .
application to organize my assignments <eos> i 'm doing my master 's degree and even though the workload is manageable , a lot of time and effort is wasted in managing and deciding the work/assignments that need to be done . i 've it all on an excel sheet but i was wondering if anyone knows of any application/software which could be used to manage work and prioritize things . i 'm looking for a smart tool which prioritizes work for me ( or at least suggests ) it based on inputs like urgency , ratio of time left etc . perhaps too much to ask from a software but you never know . thanks !

could a partial space elevator be practical and useful ? <eos> would it be technologically and economically practical to build and operate a space elevator that only provided transport between lower and higher orbital paths ? such a mechanism would only avoid some of the issues with a fixed surface-orbit elevator and would introduce other issues such as needing to dock with a platform moving at a velocity different than the local orbital velocity . somewhat related what technological barriers do we need to overcome to build a space elevator ? methods for propulsion other than rockets for leaving earth atmosphere ? ( s.f . 's answer mentions a `` partial space elevator '' linking a jet-accessible platform to leo . )

what is the argument in this paragraph <eos> what is the argument in this paragraph ( aquinas 's five ways ) : the fifth way is taken from the governance of the world . we see that things which lack intelligence , such as natural bodies , act for an end , and this is evident from their acting always , or nearly always , in the same way , so as to obtain the best result . hence it is plain that not fortuitously , but designedly , do they achieve their end . now whatever lacks intelligence can not move towards an end , unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence ; as the arrow is shot to its mark by the archer . therefore some intelligent beings exist by whom all natural things are directed to their end ; and this being we call god .

can advances in neuroscience help attain enlightenment ? will it make buddhist traditions obsolete ? <eos> correct me if i 'm wrong , but i understand that buddhists view enlightenment as a state of mind . as neuroscience progresses , we have more and more control over human brain , so inducing particular states of mind seems to be just a matter of time . does it mean that at some point in the future , assuming that the science continues to progress , we will be able to cause enlightenment by neurosurgical means ? or is there something in enlightenment that would make it impossible ? if we reach that stage , will it make all the buddhist traditions and scriptures obsolete ? after all , enlightened people can see things clearly for themselves , so there would be no point in relying on such very old sources with unknown reliability , which were heavily influenced by their cultural contexts .

cookware , copper or cast iron or just buy the right tool for the job ? <eos> i 'm thinking of replacing my motley collection of cheap non-stick and bargain basement steel pots and pans . i 'm considering either replacing with cast iron ( le creuset is probably the best known of these ) or perhaps pushing the boat out and investing in copper cookware . for someone who enjoys getting adventurous every now and again in the kitchen at home , is it worth spending extra on copper ?
what determines the shape-holding ability of cookies ? <eos> what things can you vary to make cookies hold their shape better during cooking , and not spread out like a pancake ? from my experimenting , the initial temperature of the dough before cooking seems to make a difference - refrigerated dough spreads less than room temperature . what else can i do without making the cookies too dry ? ( obviously if i add enough flour , the cookies will hold their shape , but at the cost of ending up with hard , dry bricks ) . does trying different fats like butter/shortening/margarine make a big difference ? is it worth buying heavier pans ?

help identify circa 1970s animated movie with bizarre wedding <eos> i remember a movie from my childhood that was based on a common folk tale . it was in a very odd animation style ( though i can not remember which ) . the strongest memory was that there was a very strange wedding with a fairly scary song and the guests were something like wavering creatures enchanted by an evil witch . the wedding was between `` a princess ? '' and some kind of huge and ugly ogre . i strongly remember talking to many friends about the film so it had a fairly good 'release ' but i do n't seem to have enough strong memories to hang it off of . the multitude of symbols makes it difficult to remember which folk tale it was . the vagueness of the terms have n't turned up anything in attempts to google search .

advantages of spherical harmonics over baked vertex lighting ? <eos> my question is about spherical harmonic lightning , in the context of computing the coefficients with an expensive gi algorithm and passing them to the vertex shader another way is to just use an expensive gi algorithm to compute vertex colors and just use them instead . what is the advantage of using the former method ? i 'm thinking that you ca n't do reflections with the latter method , and also there 's rotational symmetry in sh ( i do n't know much about ) that allows you to do some very simple dynamics with your lights and meshes . is there any more points i 'm missing ?
yusupov - spiridonov training question <eos> one of the lessons on the chess.com site uses the yusupov - spiridonov match , with black to play after 1.nf6+ : [ fen `` 5rk1/pb3p1p/1pr5/8/2p1p1n1/qpq1p3/4b1pp/3r2k1 w - - DIGIT 1 '' ] 1.nf6+ the `` correct '' move to make here is for the rook to take the knight , which is fine . what i did n't understand was the explanation of why that is the correct move : had he moved his king to h8 white would have played rd1-a1 after which black loses his queen to a discovered check with the knight on f6 . i ca n't see anyway that black would lose his queen . the knight moving will put the king in discovered check , but the only way i can see black losing his queen is if white sacrifices a rook . what am i missing ?

are bsde 's used in practice ? <eos> in the academic applied probability/math finance community , backwards stochastic differential equations ( bsde 's ) are extremely popular , and they provide a single framework for several different problems , notably hedging and utility maximization , where models of market imperfections might stop older models . the basic setup in a high level sense , is that you specify a terminal condition ( i.e . what you might like to hedge at the end of a trading period ) , and the dynamics in time backwards from that point . for those interested , they are not equivalent to forward sde 's precisely because there is a filtration . i 'd like to know if people are using these devices in practice , and for what purposes , and basically , what is the state of the art ?
interpretation of figure - biofunctionalization <eos> in this paper on page DIGIT they say : fluorescence analysis confirmed that enhanced protein binding at higher electron dose depends only to a small extent on the slight increase in the lateral dimensions of the nanodeposits but to a much larger degree on their height ( figure 4e ) the amount of adsorbed igg-cy3 is largely independent of the actual area of the nominal DIGIT nm islands but scales with the height of the nanodeposits . i do n't understand this yet : why do i see that the fluorescence is proportional to area in this figure ?
in the three-card monte , can a logical principle be applied to increase the odds ? <eos> assuming the game is played without cheating , in the three-card monte , can a logical approach increase the player 's chance of beating the house ? at first glance it would seem to be unlikely but a recent article in the bbc news indicates that in the somewhat similar two person game rock-paper-scissors , knowledge and application of a simple set of natural human habits can have a pretty drastic impact on the odds . assuming you know where the card started can you make a logical choice , that will identify the most likely current position ( regardless of distractions ) ?

what causes the entrainment of atmospheric gases towards a volcanic ash/tephra plume ? <eos> i understand that volcanic ash plumes can only rise to great heights ( e.g . 50km ) with the help of some other processes , as the velocity of the material ejected is n't great enough to send it high into the atmosphere . i do n't understand how exactly these processes take place . i think that cooler , atmospheric gases are entrained towards the hotter , denser volcanic plume , then become heated and incorporated into the ash plume , causing it to become buoyant and to expand . what causes the cool , atmospheric gas to move towards the plume ? is it due to the temperature differences between the plume and the atmosphere , or some kind of pressure difference ?

identify this italian sport <eos> i am trying to recall the name of a sport with the following details : the match i saw was between two italian sides and i believe it had an italian name . it is similar to football , although i believe the hands were used also . it was played on a sandy surface in an enclosed pitch ( waist-level fencing ) . the game was very violent and bloody , with punching and kicking opponents allowed . it 's not the fighting football league . it seemed perhaps to be steeped in historical tradition . it may only be contested between two cities/teams . thanks in advance !

management tactics and bonus programs <eos> i was reading the econ DIGIT management method by joel spolsky . he speaks of management tactics to motivate developers by paying them for fewer bugs ( for instance ) . he describes how bad such approach can be , and what drawbacks it has . i was wondering if this conclusion extends on the cases when the management is ready to pay a little bit more for some `` special '' tasks . for example , a developer creates a big and complicated piece of an application , and gets more money for it . is n't it better to raise the developer 's salary since he/she is qualified and experienced enough to handle such a complicated task ? or to have task-money policy ? has any manager/team leader had such an experience ?

how to refer to character of focus in a story <eos> i find that when i write , i 'm not always sure how to refer to the character of focus . you can only say `` he/she '' so many times before it feels choppy and repetitive . constantly referring to character by name feels unnatural . i 've tried using the profession of the character as well , but sometimes that just feels wordy if it is unusual ( say if the character were a taxidermist ) . even with all the different ways to define the character you are describing action for , is there any methodology for choosing which particular reference to that character you use as the passage progresses ?

aktau , kazakhstan to bukhara , uzbekistan ? <eos> i 'm currently in aqtau/aktau , kazakhstan . the trains look really tricky to get to bukhara , and i 'm wondering if there 's a better way , as currently it looks like going back up the line to beynou ( no choice ) at night , waiting until the early morning train from there to nukus or kungrad , and then down to navoi , and then hoping there 's a train , bus or taxi from there to bukhara ? the train line does n't seem to go direct to bukhara unless you go all the way to samarkand/tashkent and route back in ? any better suggestions appreciated .

why did nasa discontinue use of the mmu ? <eos> one of the comments on this recent question touched on the use of the manned maneuvering unit . it seemed like a good idea at the time : a system that would allow astronauts to do eva without being tethered . the wikipedia page on the mmu suggests that use of the mmu was stopped after a few flights because it was deemed too risky , but it does n't expand on this . were there incidents on the missions that they were used , or other technical issues ? or was it purely due to the fear of being marooned ?

can we create a galvanic cell with only half a cell connected to the ground ? <eos> i have a question about electrical potential in galvanic cells , suppose that we have only half a cell wich means that we have only one ox/red couple ( one metal and the other as ionic solution ... ) clearly nothing will happen , suppose that we put a wire between the metal and the ground .the ground has no voltage while the red/ox couple has a potential does it mean that the oxidation will happen ? and the electrons will go through the ground ? if the oxidation happens with any kind of ox/red couple , and if we take a couple wich the deltag of the oxidation reaction is very high ( so it 's very unlikely to happen all by itself ) wo n't we be creating a free source of energy ? thank you !

worthwhile from security standpoint to limit database server user for asp.net website to only execute on stored procedures ? <eos> i know that obviously we must avoid sql injection attacks through user input validation and parametrized queries . there 's already a firewall in place on the database server to limit remote connections to be accepted only from the web server . would it also add value from a security standpoint to limit the actual database user account that the asp.net website uses to the execute permission only on the stored procedures that they need ? all database interaction would take place using these stored procedures . this seems to me that even in a scenario where an attacker figures out a way to access the database connection , the attack is limited to only executing predefined queries and no open ended queries ?

best zoom poker bot strategy <eos> i 'm currently developing a poker bot that plays online by itself in zoom poker and i 'm looking at optimising the strategy . so far i 've noticed that setting an investment limit based on equity is more successful than ev . for example i set the call or bet limit to equity^4 +0.04 . if the big blind is $ 0.02 and initial pot size of $ 2.00 . so to invest $ 1 i would need DIGIT probability to win . for turn flop and river i then power the equity by a different number , which makes the criteria more or less stringent . however it seems this strategy is still too simple . in your view , what are the key parts missing ? general , is it better to play more or less aggressive pre or post flop ?
empirical ranking of firms based on productivity <eos> i want to rank firms based on a metric , let 's call it productivity . theoretically , this firm productivity measure may be well defined . empirically , however , data that account for all dimensions of productivity are generally unavailable . on the other hand , typically available data ( e.g . output/worker ) does not suffice to rank firms across industries/sectors because sector-specific differences , for instance in production technology , need to be taken into account . what empirical approach would be both feasible in the light of data availability and non-trivial with respect to the theoretical understanding of firm productivity ?
why is there a price difference between DIGIT year principal and interest strips ? <eos> sorry if this is obvious , i am not a professional . i like to trade DIGIT year treasury zero 's . i have noticed that the price for a DIGIT year principal payment is never the same as a DIGIT year interest payment . the difference is small ( ~.3 % ) , and i have n't tracked it long enough to confirm if one is always greater than the other . can anyone tell me what is going on here ? is there a tax arbitrage at play here ? is it that the principal is considered slightly more guaranteed than the interest payment ? ( or vice versa ? )

head directionality parameter and adpositions in finnish <eos> as i understand from the principles and parameters theory , all parameters are binary . in particular , the head directionality parameter can be set to either `` head-first '' or `` head-last '' . the setting of one value or the other determines , among other things , which kind of adposition the language will have . head-first generates prepositions ( e.g . english ) . head-last generates postpositions ( e.g . japanese ) . but finnish is an example of language that has both prepositions and postpositions . what am i missing ?

is a copyright license by default revocable or irrevocable ? <eos> if i grant someone a license to use a copyrighted work of mine , do i need to detail my ability to revoke the license within the terms of the license grant , or is that ability inherent to all licenses ? i understand that a copyright license could have terms like , `` this license is irrevocable '' ( as the gplv3 does ) or , `` this license may be revoked under any of the following circumstances ... '' absent any explicit language about revocability or irrevocability , what is the default rule for revoking a license ? i 'm interested in copyright licenses that are granted publicly to anyone who wants them ( e.g. , how open source software licenses are typically granted ) , but also interested in the general rule , including licenses granted to specific parties .
heuristics with time series measured in dollars <eos> suppose the price indexes are adequately measured and there are no problems regarding the data in itself . by my experience , using a sector price index -- for the industry sector that you might be analyzing -- is more adequate than a more general price index for deflating the series . but there could be a situation in which it is more adequate to use a more general price index than a sectoral price index for deflating the variables ?

why is there something instead of nothing ? <eos> a simple but fundamental question . the `` something '' means the whole universe ( known and unknown ) , it could be represented as the reality version of the set of all sets , which is itself debated . it includes all the multiverses and such . a better version of the whole universe could be described with a grothendieck universe . the `` nothing '' means an absence of the whole universe , not a particular void or emptiness in the whole universe but a nonexistent whole universe .

finding the element that occurs the most in a very large file <eos> i 've heard this interview question asked a lot and i was hoping to get some opinions on what good answers might be : you have a large file 10+ gb and you want to find out which element occurs the most , what is a good way to do this ? iterating and keeping track in a map is probably not a good idea since you use a lot of memory , and keeping track as entries come in is n't the greatest option since when this question is posed the file usually already exists . other thoughts i had included splitting the file to be iterated through and processed by multiple threads and then have those results combined , but the memory issue for the maps is still there .
is there a security risk running web apps in debug= “ true ” ? <eos> this is a copy of the original question on stack overflow which did n't get much love and is probably more relevant here : there are plenty of performance reasons why apps should n't be run in debug= '' true '' mode ( good rundown from scott gu ) , but are there any attack vectors exposed by this practice ? it 's not a question of `` should you or should n't you '' , that much is clear , it 's a question of whether it introduces any specific vulnerabilities . i 'm inclined to think that the ability to remotely detect it combined with the known performance issues could lead to an exploit against service availability but i 'd like something a bit more definite . does anyone know of a specific attack that can be orchestrated against an app running debug= '' true '' ?
why do the swap step in prim 's algorithm for minimum spanning trees ? <eos> i was watching the video lecture from mit on prim 's algorithm for minimum spanning trees . why do we need to do the swap step for proving the theorem that if we choose a set of vertices in minimum spanning tree of $ g ( v , e ) $ and let us call that $ a $ such $ asubset b $ , the edge with the least weight connecting $ a $ to $ v-a $ will always be in the minimum spanning tree ? the professor has done the swap step at point 59:07 seconds in the video .

what is the difference between a measurement and any other interaction in quantum mechanics ? <eos> we 've learned that the wave function of a particle collapses when we measure a particle 's location . if it is found , it becomes more probable to find it a again in the same area , and if not the probability to finding it in the place that was checked decreases dramatically . my question is about the definition of measurement . what makes a measurement different from any other interaction between two particles ( gravity and em fields for example ) ? in reality , almost every particle interacts with any other particle , so should n't there be constant collapse of the wave function all the time ? if this happens we 're right back in classical mechanics , are n't we ?
what is the relation between the sensation of being full and the ability to fall asleep ? <eos> i struggle with insomnia . sometimes if i 'm not able to fall asleep , one of the best ways to resolve this is to munch until i feel full , and i get so sleepy that i almost ca n't make it to the bedroom without passing out . the meal would be less than only DIGIT calories , so i do n't think this is the same as the effect you get on thanksgiving .

what temperature to prepare for on everest base camp trek ? <eos> i 'm doing the popular tourist trek from lukla to everest base camp in late april / early may . i know the minimum temperature is on average DIGIT celsius ( 30.2 fahrenheit ) in the khumbu region at this time but am wondering what temperature to prepare for in terms of buying kit . i want to ensure i am comfortable in the later , higher , stages of the trek and if the weather takes a nasty turn . i am planning to use lodges and tea houses but do not want be complacent either . so basically , what 's the lowest extreme of temperature am likely to encounter ?
the mathematics of two dimensional interpolation on a quad <eos> i am trying to wrap my head around how exactly the gpu interpolates texture coords on a quad . i realize to the gpu a quad is two triangles but i find thinking in terms of the whole quad to be easiest . if we define texture space as the texture coordinates from x : y { 0-1 } and world space as the actual coordinates of the quad how can i given a point p1 that is on the quad figure out what its texture coordinate would be ? given a texture coordinate point p2 how would i figure out its real world coordinates ? keep in mind that the quad can be any quadrilateral not necessarily always a parallelogram . as an extra note lets define the texture coordinates on the quad so that they are as such

is there a way to accept signed requests without storing client 's password in plaintext ? <eos> we are developing rest web service . we will give identifier and secret string to each of our rest clients . when doing requests , clients will authenticate themselves using hmac algorithm ( they will sign body and headers of http requests using secret string ) . rest service will receive http headers , body , finds client 's secret from database using his identifier , sign it and looks whether computed signature is equal to the signature provided by the client . actually , it 's better explained at amazon s3 authentication documentation page . in order to use this scheme we have to store clients ' secret keys in plain text , right ? is there another way to authenticate clients without storing their secret keys on our servers ( or store them in non-recoverable way , for example their md5-hashes ) ?

what are alternatives for deodorant ? <eos> there must be natural alternatives for deodorant that at least to some degree help in covering body odor caused by perspiration . i have tried to live without antiperspirant , but i do n't consider it feasible even when showering more often than once a day . i of course prefer a self-contained natural solution that i do n't have to purchase from a store . liquid ( roll-on , cream ) and solid deodorants are more environmental-friendly than aerosol sprays , but often suffer from overpackaging ; i 've owned products that weigh like lead .

when was silver ever more valuable than gold ? <eos> these days we pretty much take it as a given that gold is more valuable than silver . the obvious example is the olympics and other such competitions that give `` gold '' medals for first place and `` silver '' for second . when i was younger i read somewhere that silver was actually rarer than gold in europe , up until the spanish started exploiting the new world silver mines , and the massive infusion of silver into europe devalued it . i have n't ever seen that stated since , so i doubt its true . however , i did find a reference that silver was in fact rarer in egypt during the old kingdom . so it seems there probably were extended periods in literate areas where silver was more valuable than gold . what ( and when and where ) were they ?
is there a correlation between water bowl and litter box placement ? <eos> historically , my cat 's water bowl has always been in the vicinity of his litter box . not adjacent to it , but close by and in the same room . he has recently adopted the habit of jumping up on the bathroom counter ( different room than the litter box ) in hopes of drinking from the faucet ( regardless that the water bowl is clean and full ) . in order to dissuade that behavior , i have placed a second water bowl in the bathroom , which he seems content with . however , i 've noticed that he seems to prefer drinking from that one ; i find myself refilling it more often that the primary bowl . is there any possible explanation for this behavior ?

is abrahamic eschatology utopian ? <eos> abrahamic eschatology promises a golden age for humanity , an unending time of universal peace and prosperity . the idea of an eternally peaceful and prosperous society united in a common cause seems central to the utopian genre , so can the abrahamic religious texts describing such a promised paradise ( ezekiel , ezra , baruch , zechariah , isaiah , revelation , az-zalzalah , al-baqarah , etc ) be considered utopian ? is there sufficient distinction between the eschatologies of the abrahamic tradition that some are utopian while others are not ?

chaos theory and determinism <eos> my professor in class went a little over chaos theory , and basically said that newtonian determinism no longer applies , since as time goes to infinity , no matter how close together two initial points are , the distance between them will increase greatly . but why is n't this merely a matter of the imprecision of our measuring instruments ? if we can somehow know our initial conditions exactly , would n't we still be able to calculate what the system will be like at some time t in the future ?

obtain chemical insight from neural network results <eos> i have recently read many papers where neural networks ( nns ) are trained to predict chemical properties ( starting from the structure of small chemical compounds ) for compounds rather close to the ones with which they were trained . in some cases the predictions are rather good . but i see that apart from the predictive capability , people use nns as `` black boxes '' in the sense that they do not tell you or give you chemical insight about why that compound has that value for that predicted property . at least that is my impression now . so my question here is , do you know cases where useful chemical information can be extracted from nn predictions ?
how can i 'clean ' up my bass fretting ? <eos> i find if i 'm playing faster riffs - say hysteria by muse - i sometimes find that i hear a clunking , metallic sound as i fret . that is , the string hitting the fret . so if i fret at the 7th and then play open repeatedly , i hear the sound of the string hitting the metal bar of the fret . it 's not that i 'm fretting on the actual fret , but more the speed of the changes means that i get the metallic sound on string-on-fret . how can i avoid this , bar learning to play fretless ? ( which i really want to do , if i could afford another bass )
do two or more players colluding against honest players gain on average more money , or not ? <eos> let 's say there are two or more players that collude with each other while playing online poker against honest players . they have an obvious advantage of knowing of more cards that are in the play than the honest , non-colluding players and they can strategically bet against one another to increase the size of a pot ( encouraging other players to play in hopes of winning ) . on the other hand , they also have an obvious disadvantage - they need to split their winnings and also stand to lose more money . do such players overall expect to win more money in the end , or are their cheating attempts ultimately useless ? has such a problem perhaps been analysed scientifically ?

how do you label a sequential interval when the second note is lower in pitch than the first ? <eos> consider the interval d3 g3 . this would form a perfect fourth . in a sequential interval , say a quarter note d3 followed by quarter note g3 , this still `` sounds '' like a perfect fourth so using that interval label seems fine . however , suppose instead the sequential interval is d3 followed by g2 , thus the second note is lower pitch rather than higher . would it be more appropriate to label this interval as perfect fifth instead of a perfect fourth ? in other words , should an interval be labelled based on the lowest pitch , regardless of whether it comes before or after another note in time ?

what is `` angle of view '' in photography ? <eos> i read on the lens buying guide @ neocamera : focal-length determines the angle-of-view seen through a lens for a given sensor-size . with a full-frame sensor a lens gives the same angle-of-view as it would on a 35mm film camera . with a smaller sensor , the angle-of-view becomes smaller . the crop-factor , also called flm , is the ratio representing the difference in equivalent focal-lengths . so a 150mm on a full-frame dslr such as the nikon d700 gives the same angle-of-view as a 100mm on a d7000 since its flm is 1.5x . short focal-lengths show a greater angle-of-view compared to longer ones . [ ... ] in layman 's terms , what is angle-of-view ? is it the same as focal length ? if not , how is it different ? how is it used ? why do i need to know about it ?

how is fuel mixed with air in a jet engine ? <eos> i am working on an idea that involves a jet engine , but i do n't quite know how the fuel system works . in a combustion engine like that in a car , you have nozzles that spray the fuel into the piston chambers ( i think , correct me if i am mistaken ) , and then it 's ignited when the piston compresses the chamber ( sometimes using a spark plug , sometimes it does n't ) . how is fuel mixed with air and ignited inside a jet engine ? i know that compressed air comes from the intake system ( the fan blades pull in and compress air and direct it into the part where it mixes with fuel ) , but how does fuel get mixed in ?

signed distance field font looks odd <eos> i attempted to implement font rendering using signed distance fields . my program first generates a mono bitmap at font size DIGIT ( using freetype ) , then generates an sdf from the bitmap . this is then uploaded into a texture atlas . the results are not very nice and look nothing like the various papers show : my guess is that the bitmap does not have a high enough resolution , but i do not necessarily want to generate sdf 's larger than 64px ( they have to fit in the atlas ) . besides , at 256px , the generated sdf still has artifacts , albeit less noticable unless blown up . so how can i get better results / how am i applying the algorithm wrong ?

DIGIT degree rotation matchstick equality <eos> several matchstick digits are still digits when rotated by DIGIT degrees : note that DIGIT is rotated to DIGIT thus , we can make a matchstick arithmetic expression which is valid when rotated DIGIT degrees . for example , 1+1=2 . but , this is trivial because two expressions are the same . the following matchstick expression produces two different valid equalities : 10+02=12 and 21=20+01 . but , it 's not natural because of the leading DIGIT can you find a natural matchstick arithmetic expression which produces two different valid equalities when rotated DIGIT degrees ? maybe , the smallest answer is 0+6=6 which is turned into 9=9+0 . or 1x6=6 which is turned into 9=9x1 . but , let us exclude trivial equalities like `` 0+ ... '' , `` 0x ... '' , or `` 1x ... ''

what happens during cleaning silverware ? <eos> i know two distinct recipes for cleaning silver : put them into a pot with some club soda and a piece of aluminium foil and pour over a hot water . gently clean silverware with a fine chalk powder ( obtained from a pharmacy ) . i 'd be happy to know : what happens chemically during these procedure - why does it work , and what are the byproducts of these reactions ? how toxic ( if at all ) are the byproducts ? how much silver is lost in such a procedure ? are these procedures `` idempotent '' ? i mean , if i apply one of these procedures to an already cleaned item , will it consume some more silver , or will it remain intact ? in other words , do the reactions consume just tarnish or do they consume pure silver too ?

interpretation/use of kernel density <eos> this may be a naive question , but here goes . if i have a set of empirical data and fit a kernel density to it , and then obtain a new single value which possibly comes from the same process which generated the original data set , can i assign a probability that this new value belongs to the set/process by simply reading the value off the y axis where the new value on the x axis intersects the kernel density line and dividing by the area under the density line ?
how to properly use the umgah drone ? <eos> the umgah drone is probably my worst ship in star control melee . i know that in general i 'm supposed to zip back close to the enemy ship while constantly shooting - attempting to damage it while passing - but the combination of slow turning speed and extremely fast zipping speed always makes me miss . not to mention i generally try to be with my face to the enemy ship - in order to block shots with my cone - and this means i 'm not in the correct position to zip past them . i 've tried relying on the movement backward to dodge shots , instead of relying on the cone to destroy them ; but that really puts me in a passive position where all i do is defend and not attack . does anyone have useful tips for efficiently using the drone ?
how do you implement perspective correct gouraud shading across a triangle ? <eos> what 's the algorithm for doing so ? i have flat shading working and i have perspective correct texture mapping working . is the way your raster gouraud shading much different from the perspective correct texture mapping ? ( is gouraud shading even supposed to be perspective correct ? ) it is my understanding that you interpolate the lighting color/value down the edges , then interpolate across each scanline . however , i think i 'm stuck on how to properly divide by z for each pixel to get the correct light/color value for each pixel . any algorithm/article/tutorial would be of great help as i 've searched everywhere but can only find high level , abstract descriptions of it . thanks in advance !

why are my caramelized onions dried out ? <eos> i 've tried a few different methods of caramelizing onions - several combinations of butter , olive oil , medium heat , low heat , occasional/constant stirring . it seems that no matter what i do , they dry up and turn crispy as they brown . the flavor is there , but the texture is more like onion straws than the soft , juicy onions i 'm trying to make . am i cooking too long ? not stirring enough ? i 'm sure it 's something simple i 've just missed . i am aware of this question . i 've followed similar techniques , i 'm just not getting the results i 'm looking for . i hope that 's enough to constitute another question .

quantity of new trees needed to compensate all human co₂ pollution <eos> that trees are the major tools to remove co₂ from the air is clear , but how many new trees need to be planted to compensate all human co₂ pollution ( 6 gigatons / year ? ) ? we should work with standard tree and count a tree in the tropics double since they absorb year round . if yearly net uptake of growing trees is 20kg co₂ in temperate zones , global average might be 30kg/year . this means that `` only '' DIGIT × 10¹² kg ÷ DIGIT kg = DIGIT × 10⁹ = DIGIT bn trees are needed . i say `` only '' because this means only DIGIT extra forest , while i was counting on a doubling of global tree cover is needed ( and possible ) .

plato 's socrates contradicts himself ... or does he ? <eos> in his apology plato 's socrates clearly indicates he would continue to philosophize even if the court ordered him not to -- clearly he does not believe one must obey the laws of the state . in his crito , however , he accepts a death sentence and refuses to escape from an unjust conviction -- he chooses to obey the state 's laws . it seems there is an inconsistency or contradiction here -- either one has to obey the laws or one does n't ! which is plato 's real view ? if plato 's socrates is willing to disobey a bad law which says `` do n't philosophize , '' why wo n't he disobey the state when it comes to life and death ?

mems accelerometer calibration <eos> i am trying to calibrate a mems accelerometer . i was able to calibrate it for the current axis which is parallel to gravity and shows correctly , 1g . but the other two axes which should be 0.00g are showing +-0.02g instead . so , e.g. , when the accelerometer 's x axis is parallel to gravity , it should show ( 1g , 0g , 0g ) and not ( 1g , 0.02g , -0.01g ) like now . how could i eliminate those values , e.g . further calibrate accelerometer ? edit : the acelerometer 's datasheet says nothing about calibrating except that the ic interface is factory calibrated for sensitivity ( so ) and zero-g level ( off ) ( page 20 ) .
which phenomena compensate for sound losses in languages ? <eos> there is a tendency in all of the world ’ s languages to drop word sounds , especially unstressed syllables . one example is the word for “ winter ” in proto-algonquian , “ peponwi ” , which developed into “ aa ” in cheyenne , after a series of sound droppings1 . so , other processes must take place in order to counterbalance this tendency . one such process is grammaticalization , which transforms content words into functional words . eventually some of these functional words become affixes . that way , while some sounds are eroded , new sounds get incorporated into old words . are there other phenomena , besides grammaticalization , that compensate for the loss of sounds in a language ?

the thin line between winning and losing at the top level ? <eos> at lower level , we often blunder many times and do not make the best moves , so there can be multiple ways to win . but at the top level , for example , during the candidate matches going on now , the masters do not blunder often and they do not make very many mistakes , so i have noticed a theme which is not just in these games , but in others , and that is that the difference between winning and losing can come down to a single pawn for them and they will often fight to the death over one square . i have noticed that for example if white attacks e4 , black will immediately strive to defend it and they will battle over one square . is my assessment correct on this ? are there other factors at the top level ?

turing machine-like formalism for the actor model <eos> turing machines have a formal symbol alphabet , state and transition-rules based description of how a computation is done . the actor model is sometimes mentioned as a more powerful computational-model than turing machines ( not in what it can compute , but in other aspects ) . is the actor model a full fledged turning machine alternative as a computational model ? does the actor model also have such a symbol-based formal computation description akin to the turing machine ? are the actors assumed to be turing machine equivalent - since each message is processed sequentially ( and atomically ) ? there are many theoretical results based on turing machines , e.g . the halting problem , decidability , relation to gödel 's incompleteness theorem etc . can these proofs be formally generalize to the actor model ? has this been done ?

non-tonal `` isolates '' within families of tonal languages <eos> i 've put `` isolates '' in scare quotes because this is probably not a standard meaning for the term `` language isolate '' . but anyway i 'm sure it 's still abvious what i 'm looking for . i was wondering about languages losing or merging tones until there are none left . since that would take a long time we might not have evidence of such occuring . but what we might possibly have are instances of non-tonal languages within language families which otherwise consist mostly of tonal languages . if this does n't exist i 'm also interested in cases of a language with far fewer tones than most of its sibling and cousin languages .

how do the bubble oscillations in two-phase flows affect the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy ? <eos> i am investigating the effects of bubble oscillations ( calculated using the rayleigh-plesset equation for bubble dynamics ) on the turbulence in two-phase flows . since i am using cryogenic fluids , the thermal effects also play a role . i am trying to find out the connection between the oscillation frequencies and how they influence the turbulence dissipation rate . i guess that , when the frequencies are high , i.e. , when the liquid-vapour interface oscillates at high frequencies , the turbulent kinetic energy in the flow increases . so , will the dissipation rate also increase proportionally to the turbulent kinetic energy ? ( epsilon proportional to k^1.5 )

why do most words for `` mother '' , across languages , start with an [ m ] , and for `` father '' with [ p ] / [ b ] , but not vice versa ? <eos> it has been observed that in general , a word for `` mother '' tends to be based on a bilabial nasal [ m ] or similar consonant , and for father it tends to be [ b ] or [ p ] . this is found in many language families , so they ca n't be considered cognates . this is usually explained by the easiness of babies making this sound early in their babbling , so the parents just use those sounds to refer to themselves . however why is it that few languages have used the reverse ? ( i.e . [ p ] / [ b ] for mother and [ m ] for father ) ? wikipedia lists only georgian , where `` father '' is /mama/ and `` mother '' is /deda/ .

how to choose a safe cliff path <eos> when walking alongside eroding cliffs in more built up / touristy areas , there 's usually big warning signs or closed paths if the cliff is unsafe to walk on . sometimes it 's obvious why , if the path is very close to the sea or has disappeared altogether . if walking in a more rural place though , it 's likely that the cliff is n't inspected regularly and therefore such signs do n't necessarily exist . what should i look out for , if anything aside from the obvious ( big cracks , paths perilously close to the edge ) to determine if such a path is relatively safe to walk on ?

feasibility of sorting a basket of clothes in the real world <eos> i 'm wondering how feasible it is to create a machine that can separate clothing from a basket . at the most basic level it would distinguish between tops , pants , button downs and socks programmatically , i 'd image this would require training a neural network to recognize these items , but in real time it becomes exponentially difficult to do this in a small space at a fast rate : pick up an item lay it in such a way that is recognizable deduce whether it is a top , button down , etc . sort it accordingly if this sounds ridiculous please let me know ... if it is possible : would this be based on some sort of computer vision ? or only a well trained neural network ? any insight is much appreciated !

what is the significance of `` jonathan '' in strange and norrell ? <eos> at least four major characters have the name `` john '' or `` jonathan '' , including jonathan strange , john segundus , john childermass , and john uskglass . this is potentially confusing to a reader . in particular the name `` john segundus '' threw me : it 's a very odd english name , and hinted at possibly being a pseudonym , perhaps for strange himself before the character is introduced . john is a very common name , and while it 's reasonable to know several `` john '' s in real life , i would expect most authors to keep character names fairly distinct for the convenience of readers . * is clarke hinting at something , or is it just a part of her often-enigmatic style ?

the contribution to mass from the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry <eos> the claim is often made that the discovery of the higgs boson will give us information about the origin of mass . however , the bare masses of the up and down quarks are only around DIGIT mev , quite a bit smaller than their `` constituent '' or `` dynamical '' mass of around DIGIT mev . ( remember that a neutron , for example , is one up and two down quarks and has a total mass of DIGIT mev . ) what then , is the reasoning behind the claim that the higgs will address the origin of mass when by far the majority of the mass of the neutron ( and proton ) is related instead to the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry ?

short story about a man condemned to death because he can not remember the details about a country <eos> i once read a short story about a man ( a journalist ? ) visiting a prison inmate . he was incarcerated for a crime he did not commit , and it was a case of mistaken identity or insufficient alibi . the conviction hinged on the fact that he could not prove that he was really himself because he could not remember the location of a country he had been to . the story ended with the journalist leaving the prison making a note to himself to remember things so as to not be in such a situation himself . please identify the story . i must have read it a decade ago , but the story itself was probably very old ( a century old or more , think o.henry/maupassant/hawthorne… ) . i read the story in english , but it could have been a translation .

what does the many-body problem say about mathematical physics ? <eos> i was interested to read the answers to the other many-body problem questions on this site and was left with one nagging question of my own . what does the many-body problem reveal about reality and our attempt to understand it ? to explain : if the solutions we find to this problem are in the form of lengthy iterative expansions may this not signify in some way that nature operates along discrete iterative paths ? what does this say about our theories if these problems are so difficult/time-consuming for them but so quickly solved by the real world around us ? is this problematic ? will more complete theories-ie possibly string theory- address this or do they even need to ?

most natural generalization of covariance/correlation to model dependence of extreme events <eos> one of the most serious shortcomings of covariance/correlation are the assumptions of linearity and normality . what is the most natural generalization of these measures of dependence when you want to model the dependence structure of extreme events using heavy-tailed distributions , e.g . the generalized extreme value distribution ? with `` most natural generalization '' i mean that the classical covariance/correlation is included as a special case when the usual assumptions hold . ( disclosure : this question was posted at cross validated nearly two weeks ago , yet did n't receive any answers )

what prompted the producers of happy days to promote and spin-off mork and mindy ? <eos> happy days maintained a fairly realistic bent throughout it 's run ( i 'm not here to debate shark jumping , i promise ) . two notable detours from this were mork and mindy and out of the blue . mork seemed like an random introduction to the show , and would end up in colorado on his show , far away from milwaukee , so he would n't have even been considered a `` tv neighbor '' to the cunninghams anyway . what was the decision-making behind conceiving the mork character within the happy days universe ? why was it decided that it was worth risking the alienation of the existing audience for a show that might not take off at all ?

how to cover an open-top shower , to make it feel warmer while showering <eos> there is a product on the local market in new zealand called `` showerdome '' that is a clear plastic dome that can be attached over the top of most open top showers . covering the top of a shower reduces the convection air flow that naturally occurs when showering , as well as increasing the humidity while showering , which has the effect that one feels warmer and can turn the temperature down and reduce hot water use . it also heavily reduces the steam escaping the shower , so also heavily reduces condensation and associated mould problems in the bathroom . however , `` showerdomes '' are quite expensive . are there other designs or products available for achieving the same result ?

is potable water in the american & russian segments still stored separately ? <eos> this article writes to say an interesting fact is that the russian and american segment water supplies can ’ t be mixed . the u.s. water uses iodine for bacteria control , while the russian water uses silver . if these substances mix , a silver-iodine precipitate forms in the water , which may clog the sublimator in the nasa emu spacesuit . i assume this last mention about the precipitate means the water from both segments must be stored separately . is potable water in the american & amp ; russian segments still stored separately ? does it carry the caveat a russian may not drink water in the american section , and v.v ? if such caveat is meaningless , does it follow the precipitate ( is it silver iodide ? ) absorbed into the body of the drinker ?

context-free grammar for $ \ { a^n b^m a^ { n+m } \ } $ <eos> i 've got a problem with this task . i should declare a context-free grammar for this language : $ qquad displaystyle l : = { , a^nb^ma^ { n+m } : n , m in mathbb { n } , } $ my idea is : we need a start symbol , for example $ s $ . i know that i can generate the first $ a $ and the last $ a $ by $ s to a a $ . i do n't know what is the next idea to solve this task .
practicing drums with metronome and not hearing it 's tick <eos> often times when i 'm doing simple strokes ( as from stick control ) to the tick of a metronome , i get into streaks of not hearing the metronome , just my strokes . i suppose that 's a good thing , right ? meaning it 's well coordinated enough as to suppress the metronome 's tick . but since it 's just my guess , i wanted to know if it 's something to aim for . maybe consistently hearing the tick just after the stroke could be more desirable , i do n't know . and i often wonder if i do n't subconsciously do louder strokes as to suppress the tick , masking my actual timing precision .
how can higher co-moments be applied to portfolio optimization in an asset allocation context ? <eos> traditional portfolio optimization involves mean variance optimization , where only the mean and covariance matrix of returns are estimated . what asset allocation and portfolio optimization techniques make use of the higher order co-moments of the returns distribution ? also , how would one compute the higher order matrices ?
what tempo is agitato ? <eos> i 'm looking at rachmaninoff 's prelude in c # minor and notice that the tempo changes from lento to agitato . i 'm familiar with the former tempo marking , but not the latter . at what tempo should agitato be played ? i suspect there is more meaning than just tempo and maybe that tempo is n't even the primary meaning of the term , musically . so , besides tempo , how else should agitato be played ? by the way , i have heard rachmaninoff 's piece played before , so i have at least a general idea . i 'm more interested in the meaning of the term in general than in how it applies to prelude in c # minor .

is there a way for me to record every shading sample for a deep texture <eos> im developing a deep texture processing engine . right now i have a software renderer to generate the raster samples . now , for bigger renders it would be nice to do this on hardware . is there a standard mechanism on how to capture the data of each shader evaluation in opengl ? i could do some sort of depth peeling but it seems to me as a bit too brute forcelike approach . i do n't mind the time cost just as long as it does not take ages to implement the infrastructure needed .

how does directional gaussian blurring work ? <eos> in image editing software , you often have the ability to do a directional blur where you can choose and angle and a magnitude of a blur . how does this actually work in practice with gaussian blurring ? i could see possibly doing something like making the blur go across the axis specified by the angle and use some sort of texture sampling to find the appropriate sample ( bilinear or bicubic sampling ) , but that seems like it probably is n't correct . how does directional blurring usually work ? i would say this is in fact motion blur , but i 'm asking specifically about the blurring portion , not the whole set up for motion blur within a renderer . for instance before and after :

to understand why satellite cells are genetically inactive in barr body <eos> dapi is used as a stain for dna heterochromatic and euchromatic regions . the barr body is heterochromatic . in the slide of a normal human female cheek 's somatic cells , there is apparently no other clear dark spot inside the nucleus than the barr body against the nuclear inner membrane . - - i used an old microscope so my observation may be wrong as pointed in the comment . how can you deduce from the given slide that the spot really contains inactive satellite cells that are not used genetically ? why is the active x chromosome not visible by the same staining method ? ( it probably can be made visible by some other staining method . )

potential functions <eos> can someone please explain what a potential is ? example . velocity potential in ideal flows , acoustic potential ( gradient of which gives the particle velocity in a sound wave ) . whenever i see potential functions complex analysis is applied to compute integrals , complex functions for conformal mapping . i vaguely understand that potential functions are independent of path and in complex plane the integration around a contour is independent of path as well ( the integration depends only on the end points , hence in a closed curve say region $ z $ , if function , $ f $ is analytic then integration of $ f $ over $ z $ is 0 ) . can you please explain on this ?

is ship turn rate still limited by the `` viewport '' ? what ships turn faster if you `` zoom out '' in third person view ? <eos> i know people hate flying in third person view in allegiance : the ship is dead center on the screen and you ca n't see what you are hitting . this question is , however , about those moments when you are n't hitting anything ( be it reloading or just travelling around ) and tapping f11 might let you outmaneuver your enemy . ( basically , the further you zoom in , the slower rotating your ship is . however , apparently , some ships can turn around so fast they were limited in the turn rate even when fully zoomed out . ) however , i think i recall this was one of the bugs fixed in r5 or r6 , but i ca n't find it on the trac . any ideas ?

dog drinks a lot of water and spits it back up <eos> recently , my puppy ( a ~5.5 month old pembroke welsh corgi ) has started to drink a ton of water from his bowl ( sometimes as much as half the bowl ) , and then a few minutes later , he will spit up some of the water . it 's usually a pretty small amount that comes back up ( and it rarely has any solids in it , mostly just water ) . i 'm wondering if this is an issue that i should take him to the vet for , or if there 's something i can do to make him stop drinking so much at once . or possibly that he just needs to drink more often , in smaller amounts .
if the t-test and the anova for two groups are equivalent , why are n't their assumptions equivalent ? <eos> i 'm sure i 've got this completely wrapped round my head , but i just ca n't figure it out . the t-test compares two normal distributions using the z distribution . that 's why there 's an assumption of normality in the data . anova is equivalent to linear regression with dummy variables , and uses sums of squares , just like ols . that 's why there 's an assumption of normality of residuals . it 's taken me several years , but i think i 've finally grasped those basic facts . so why is it that the t-test is equivalent to anova with two groups ? how can they be equivalent if they do n't even assume the same things about the data ?

why is the term structure curve of agricultural commodities often downward sloping ? <eos> i have retrieved the below term structure curve for livestock ( lean hogs ) from bloomberg and noticed that it is inverted . i have a vague intuition that this has to do with the storage costs and perishability of agricultural underlyings , but i lack a rigorous explanation . searching for the solution online has yielded publications and phd theses on term structure models which slightly exceed my understanding as an undergraduate student . i would thus greatly appreciate any suggestions for economic explanations .

why does the g1 term have a DIGIT in the numerator in walter 's formula , but not in heitz 's generalized formula ? <eos> in understanding the masking-shadowing function in microfacet-based brdfs , eric heitz derives the separable masking and shadowing function as ( p.83-84 ) : in the mentioned microfacet models for refraction through rough surfaces by walter et al. , smith term is computed as : i do n't see a parameterisation of λ that could make appear the generic form ( heitz version ) from the specific form derived by walter . what am i missing ?
can we have incomplete markets with a continuum of securities ? <eos> imagine there is a continuum of firms in the economy . each draws its productivity from the same stochastic process . the stochastic process has unbounded support . the only securities in the economy are the firm 's shares . the claim is that markets are incomplete because the cardinality of the states of the world is $ aleph_2 $ and the cardinality of the securities is $ aleph_1 $ . however one could also argue that since there is a continuum of firms , the strong law of large numbers applies and one knows exactly the proportion of firms that will get each shock , hence there is no risk ( and markets would be complete ) which of the two statements is correct ?

what times of the year are best for visiting france ? <eos> when i visited rome , italy , i ended up visiting during august which seems to be a time when most italians have fled the city to cooler areas . this was nice because there was less traffic so we were able to move around better . at the same time , it was really quite hot , which was not as fun . i 'm definitely not a fan of crowds , but i would rather deal with crowds than with bad weather and less activities . what are the ideal times of the year to visit france , particularly paris , balancing out weather , crowds ( locals and tourists ) , and available activities ( festivals and such ) ?

how can a database derived from copyrighted works be public domain ? <eos> i 've been using the website refractiveindex.info to get some optical constants for a physics project . it seems like all the graphs reference a book or some source for the data they contain . for example , the most popular one would probably be for water ( located here ) , which references g. m. hale and m. r. querry . optical constants of water in the 200-nm to 200-µm wavelength region , appl . opt . 12 , DIGIT ( 1973 ) . when i read about the database here , the author says that he has released the database to the public domain . how can he do that if the data in this database is not really his own ? also this leaves me unsure exactly how to cite the source . it feels odd to not include the authors of the actual data .

difference between reductions in algebraic problems versus reductions in computational intractability <eos> when i read about np-completeness for the first time , i really wondered why is the concept of reductions given such high emphasis , after all we have been looking at concepts such as reductions and 'special case of one another problem ' in mathematics since elementary algebra . what i mean by reductions in algebra is the following . problem 1 : find value of x such that $ x^2+ax+b=0 $ problem 2 : find value of x such that $ ( x+m/n ) ^2=0 $ we can go on proving both the problems are same and one solution can be translated to another . my question is that `` is the concept of reductions in computational intractability same as that in above algebraic theory ? '' if not , how are the reductions in ci theory different ?

how can i tell which matrix decomposition to use for ols ? <eos> i want to find the least squares solution to $ boldsymbol { ax } =boldsymbol { b } $ where $ boldsymbol { a } $ is a highly sparse square matrix . i found two methods that look like they might lead me to a solution : qr factorization , and singular value decomposition . unfortunately , i have n't taken linear algebra yet , so i ca n't really understand most of what those pages are saying . i can calculate both in matlab though , and it looks like the svd gave me a smaller squared error . why did that happen ? how can i know which one i should be using in the future ?

is an attack on a local bitcoind via an img or embedded flash viable ? <eos> in this thread on the bitcoin forums it was suggested that a local attack on bitcoind might be possible through malformed img tags or ( more likely in my opinion ) through embedded flash . this also brings up the possibility of exploitation via java et al . unfortunately i do n't know enough about flash to determine whether it 's prevented from connecting to a listening client on localhost . i would assume it 's sandboxed away from anything else on the local network , but i honestly do n't know if they 've bothered to restrict access to localhost .

what is the difference between statistics and biostatistics ? <eos> it occurred to me that , while i 've pieced together some ideas over the years about the differences between statistics and biostatistics , i 've never heard a formal explanation . what is the distinction between these two disciplines ( currently ) ? and why did this distinction begin in the first place ? edit : i 've not been specific enough in my original question . i understand that biostatistics is the application and development of statistics in the biomedical field . but what are some specific examples of the distinctions ? for example , what distinguishes graduate education in the two fields ? what is the purpose of having distinct academic departments for the two disciplines ( a distinction i see in no other field ) ?
twelve balls on a scale , where one ball is lighter and another is heavier <eos> suppose you have twelve identical-looking balls . ten of them are the same weight , but one is slightly lighter and one slightly heavier , in such a way that the weight of the lighter and heavier ball add up to exactly the weight of two of the equal-weight balls . what is the minimum number of weighings on a two-sided scale that are needed to determine which ball is lighter and which one is heavier ? what would the solution be if the weight of the lighter and heavier ball did n't necessarily add up to the weight of two equal balls , but you did n't know whether it was lighter , heavier , or equal to that weight ?

what is the practical limit on the number of storeys in residential buildings built with monolithic reinforced concrete ? <eos> i have recently bought a flat in a 25-storey building . i wonder what is the practical limit for the number of storeys in a mass-produced residential buildings built from monolithic reinforced concrete ? can we expect the number of storeys in typical buildings of this type to rise in the forthcoming years or this is the reasonable limit of the technology ? in all references i saw so far it was claimed that this technology has no limits on the height of the buildings . but i doubt this because all skyscrapers i know were built from steel . if monolithic reinforced concrete has no limitations , why have very tall buildings not been built with this technology ?

will the current at the inversion potential of a cv trace asymptotically approach zero ? <eos> reading up on the theory of cyclic voltammetry , i note that the current at the inversion potential ( that is , the point at which the applied potential goes negative ) in every reversible cv trace i have seen is nonzero . my intuition says that this is related to the finite speed of enlargement of the depletion zone around the working electrode and suspect that given sufficient time this current will drop away to zero as the bulk solution homogenises . is this correct ? if not , what accounts for the current ?

does pennsylvania have a mature minor doctrine ? <eos> i 'm not trying to get medical care , i 'm just curious . i was wondering if the state of pennsylvania had what is known as a `` mature minor doctrine '' which , if i understand correctly , would allow minors , in a limited set of circumstances , to consent to medical treatment in lieu of their parents if said minor could demonstrate a level of knowledge and maturity necessary to make such decision . i know that some other states have this statute in their medical codes , and it varies from state to state what the implementation of this law . if pa does have such a doctrine , what are its specifics ( age , how maturity is determined , etc . ) and if it falls under pa emancipation law ( which to my knowledge is horrendously complected . )
does the genetic expression of specific physical traits ever correlate to behaviour ? <eos> over at skeptics , there were a couple questions asked as to the correlation of specific physical traits in relation to personality/behaviour . for instance , the simian line as well as red hair . now , i did my best to answer these questions , with what i understand as there being a long history of people attempting to correlate external physical characteristics with behaviour ( see the disgraced `` art '' of phrenology for instance ) . however , in answering the simian line question , i did come across some weak correlations . it got me to wondering if this is an area of exploration in terms of perhaps one gene sequence for a physical trait somehow being tied with another gene sequence for behaviour . so , do any physical characteristics being expressed through genes correlate to behaviour ?
how does the stem-loop cause intrinsic transcription termination ? <eos> in this animation , towards the end ( about three quarters ) the process of transcription termination is shown . it states that the transcribed rna forms a hairpin loop ( or stem-loop ) , which halts the transcription process . my question is , why does it halt the transcription process , considering that the rna polymerase moves in the opposite direction of where the stem loop is created ? does it somehow change the rna conformation such that no further bases can be added ? interpreting it as a physical obstacle does n't seem to make any sense here .

how does the law guarantee true disregard by jurors ? <eos> how can the court and public guarantee disregard by jurors when they 're instructed to do so ? i doubt that a verbal instruction suffices , when judges themselves can be biased . what forestalls or thwarts such potential subconscious regard or bias ? source : richard a. posner , how judges think ( 2008 ) , p. DIGIT top . criminal defendants are at a disadvantage if a judge 's or prosecutor 's missteps can be forgiven by the judge 's telling the jury to disregard them , for the bell can not be unrung ; the jurors can not exclude what they should not have heard from their consideration of the defendant 's guilt .

why are tennis players active in multiple events during a grand slam ? <eos> now wimbledon is going on for over a week , i wonder why some players enter mutliple events on the same grand slam , e.g . the williams sisters that in the past participated in the women 's singles and doubles . there are plenty of players that start in the single or ( midex ) double . my question is why do tennis-players do this ? i can imagine that playing in multiple events is exhausting if you survive a few rounds , and playing in the doubles does negatively affect once performance in the singles . on the other hand they might earn more money , or do n't expect to get far in either of the events , but that does not hold for the williams sisters .

does a negative claimant have a burden of proof ? <eos> i have often heard it said that the burden of proof is on the positive claimant but not on the one making a negative claim . a person claiming , `` god exists '' has a burden of proof but not a person claiming , `` god does not exist . '' if i assert , `` object a does not exist '' then this assertion implies a weaker assertion that is a positive claim . namely , `` there exists at least one universe in which object a does not exist . '' since the latter claim is a positive assertion then the burden of proof follows . all claims of nonexistence can be reformulated into a claim of existence using the trick , `` there exists at least one universe in which ... . '' thus the burden of proof falls to claims of nonexistence , right ?

is it possible to crystallize a solid ingot of metal from an ( acidic ) aquaous solution ? <eos> to my knowledge , metalic ions only precipitate from a solution as salts & amp ; and a process that could possibly produce monocristalline metal would be very interesting indutrially - i 've never heard of one , so i do n't think it is possible . but : is it not conceivable to dissolve a metal in an acid ( or maybe base ) , and then ( later ) neutralize the acid , without resulting ions that form a salt with the metal ? what am i missing ? as an aside , i arrived at this question while thinking if there could be a biological , and thus wet-chemical , pathway from ores to pure metals ( in metallic form ) . the last step in a such a process would be the precipitation/crystallization as a metal .

what is natural bond orbital theory used for ? <eos> my understanding is that the nbo methodology transforms the molecular orbital picture of a molecule into a collection of pairwise interactions ( bond orbitals ) . this is obviously handy for didactic and comprehension purposes as it distils what might be a very complex and non-local mo picture into manageable lobes conforming to the introductory theories of chemical bonding ( vb , orbital hybridisation ) taught in high-school and early university courses . does natural bond orbital theory have utility outside of this role ?

did any of alfred hitchcock 's american films receive poor reviews upon release ? <eos> i could see reviewers taking issue with some elements of psycho , ( namely the shower scene ) , though the violence is understated and possibly more of a distraction from the mystery and suspense . in the birds , we see small school-children being attacked by flocks birds -- an image that could easily offend family-minded reviewers . were scenes like these enough to upset reviewers ? if not by the violence , perhaps the sexual elements present in hitchcock 's films ? hitchcock chose stunningly beautiful women like grace kelly , eva marie saint and tippi hedren to star in his films -- perhaps they found the thought of lisa and 'jeff ' jeffries spending the night together too forward for the time ?

did the greek adverb for `` late '' evolve into a preposition meaning `` after '' ? <eos> the greek work opse meant late in homer . by the time of philostratus ( 3rd c. a.d. ) it sometimes had the meaning of too late . of course , if someone arrives too late for an event , they arrive `` after '' it . modern greek does n't have the word opse . my theory is that the adverb opse ( late ) morphed into a preposition ( after ) . but , greek already has meta meaning after . so , opse faded out of existence . does my theory seem correct ? is it way off base ? your critique will be most valuable for my research .

topological methods in finance <eos> recently a promising start-up ( ayasdi ) has made headlines . they are a spin-off of the applied and computational algebraic topology group of stanford university ( comtop ) . what they basically do is visualizing the topological structure of big data . now i know that this idea of applied ( algebraic ) topology crops up from time to time also in finance , see e.g . this blog post from quantivity : manifold learning . there is even an r-package with which you can play around ( the concept behind it is persistent homology which is a robust variant of the topological invariant ) : phom . my question i am interested in applications of topological methods in finance , i.e . references ( books , papers , articles ) and software applications , that you can use to do some tests on your own .

what 's a good market for experimental novellas ? <eos> a short story of mine has grown until it 's become a bit of a monster - about 15k . i do n't know if that makes it a novelette or a novella , but it 's certainly too long for most of the journals i would normally consider for submission . a superstitious dread of talking too much about my work before it 's published prevents me from going into too much detail . but i can say that the story is told from an unusual perspective , that the setting is historical , and it 's definitely non-realist ( although it is n't genre fantasy or magical realism , either ) . what would be a good market for experimental novellas ? i tend to prefer print , but for this awkwardly-sized piece i 'd ( reluctantly ) consider an ebook publisher .

why is radix sort $ o ( n ) $ ? <eos> in radix sort we first sort by least significant digit then we sort by second least significant digit and so on and end up with sorted list . now if we have list of $ n $ numbers we need $ log n $ bits to distinguish between those number . so number of radix sort passes we make will be $ log n $ . each pass takes $ o ( n ) $ time and hence running time of radix sort is $ o ( n log n ) $ but it is well known that it is linear time algorithm . why ?

does speaking the same language reduce the likelihood of war ? <eos> one idea i 've heard from time to time is that if we all spoke one language , we would n't have war any more . i can think of counter-examples to this . for example , the invasion of kuwait by iraq ( both arabic-speaking ) as an international war , and countless civil wars such as somalia . however , does sharing the same language play any role in the likelihood of war , either by decreasing or , perhaps counter-intuitively , increasing it ?
closed game effect for white <eos> as my friend said a moment ago , the closed game type is bad practice for white because it brings white often to draw rather than win . if i want to get a better chance of winning , i should choose open game but be careful about counterattack . however , there seem to be openings which are categorized in the middle [ between open game and closed game ] . i am annoyed a bit . but when i checked with shredder , it seems rather true . is it true ? ?
is the united states primary system detrimental to moderate candidates ? <eos> the argument says that because candidates must prove themselves as the most potent standard bearer for their respective parties in the primary election ( to even get a shot at the general election ) , it becomes impossible for moderate candidates from either major party to survive to the general election . is this an innate feature of the party primary system that exists throughout the democratic world in party primaries , or something specific to the united states and its electorate ?

how would ai be able to self-examine ? <eos> as i see some cases of machine-learning based artificial intelligence , i often see they make critical mistakes when they face inexperienced situations . in our case , when we encounter totally new problems , we acknowledge ourselves that we are not skilled enough to do the task and hand it to someone who is capable of doing the task . would ai be able to self-examine objectively and determine if it is capable of doing the task ? if so , how would it be accomplished ?

'' granted , orren boyle was notoriously inept , does n't appear to actually produce all that much steel ( and what little he produces appears to go mostly to those with political pull ) , and routinely failed to deliver on orders , but it 's not like jim was about to admit that .

what is the difference between `` aggregation '' and a `` representative agent ? '' <eos> what is the difference between `` aggregation '' and a `` representative agent ? '' i 'm sorry if i 'm not entirely clear on this question , but that 's why i ask . it seems to me as if a representative agent is defined as a situation in which a competitive equilibrium can be reached by maximizing the utility of an object that can be interpreted as a `` representative agent '' whereas `` aggregation '' refers to a related situation where in competitive equilibrium prices do n't depend on the distribution of an initial endowment . ( something to this effect . ) could somebody clarify what these two concepts are and how they are related and/or different ?
does it make sense to train an autoencoder using data from different distributions ? <eos> say i have DIGIT variables and i believe those variables can be shown in a 4-dimensional latent representation which i want to learn . what i have for training is 100k samples , and those samples are coming mainly from DIGIT unbalanced groups : 1st group has 1k samples , 2nd group has 49k samples , and 3rd group has 50k samples . do you think i can learn a meaningful representation by training a ( variational ) autoencoder with this data ? is there a reason that requires all samples to come from the same distribution ? if not , is there a reason that requires balanced classes ?

why is encrypting with the same one-time-pad not good ? <eos> to encrypt a message $ m_1 $ with a one-time-pad key $ k $ you do $ enc ( m_1 , k ) = m_1 oplus k $ . if you use the same $ k $ to encrypt a different message $ m_2 $ you get $ enc ( m_2 , k ) = m_2 oplus k $ , and if you perform xor of the two ciphertext you get $ $ ( m_1 oplus k ) oplus ( m_2 oplus k ) = m_1 oplus m_2 $ $ so , ok , there is some information leakage becuse you learn $ m_1 oplus m_2 $ , but why is it not secure ? i have no way to learn ( say ) $ m_1 $ unless i know $ m_2 $ . so why is it wrong to use $ k $ twice ? ?

what is the most sustainable way of making coffee ? <eos> which method of brewing coffee is the most sustainable ? the criteria being : minimal waste , minimal energy ( no matter where it 's produced ) i guess for the optimal solution it would be necessary to ... use organic and fair trade coffee not heat more water than necessary use a french press or a similar system that produces zero waste ( filters , capsules , etc. ) . a french pressed coffee also contains more coffeine , so that i can drink less of it . reuse or recycle the coffee grounds , for example as garden fertilizer . buy the coffee beans in bigger bags ( to minimize waste ) and grind them myself am i missing on something or is something from this list not really necessary ?

the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics <eos> john cramer ’ s transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics ( tiqm ) is billed as resolving the fuzzy agnosticism of the copenhagen interpretation while avoiding the alleged ontological excesses of the many worlds interpretation . yet it has a low profile . is this because no-one care anymore about ontology in physics , or is there something about tiqm which undermines belief in it ?

how does one recognized td/oh symmetry in molecules ? <eos> the identification of point groups of a molecule is usually done following a strict scheme , either manually or algorithmically . in all textbooks i could find , however , the first step of the scheme is actually not explicited : in this example scheme drawn from housecroft and sharpe , you can see that there is a very unhelpful step “ does this molecule have $ i_h $ , $ o_h $ or $ t_d $ symmetry ? ” . it is implied that one would recognize e.g . an icosahedral molecular compound on sight . however , i wonder : how can one strictly identify these “ special ” point groups ? what set of rules is to be followed ( again , either manually or algorithmically ) ?

how can i make two chicken mothers eat peacefully ? <eos> two of my chickens just hatched their eggs and i noticed since then that whenever i call them to give all of them food , two of the chicken mothers start fighting for where to eat . i did n't worry until now because i usually notice this whenever two of my chickens hatch their eggs around the same period . i solved this problem by spreading the food , the chicken mothers will then go to two locations and stop fighting . however , doing that still does n't solve the problem of these two . no matter how far i spread the food , they will fight to eat at the same spot . what is the cause of their fight ? how can i stop it and make them eat peacefully ?

should i ask my new employer for an extra laptop charger ? <eos> i do not want to be perceived as overly demanding , high maintenance , or downright lazy in my new job , but i do dislike having to carry/pack any more work equipment than just my mac book . carrying the charger around introduces the possibility of me losing it , and having one charger at home and one at work would make the process of dock alternation really simple . the thing is , mac chargers are rather pricey ( about $ 50 ) and i just started the job two weeks ago . is this a frivolous request ?

would you save energy by heating the air in a shower stall so that you could use colder water ? <eos> it is refreshing to take a cool shower in hot weather . and for the sake of discussion , lets assume that one should be `` comfortable '' with temeratures when taking a shower . considering that the vast majority of the heat from a shower is lost down the drain , would it not be more energy efficient to heat a confined space ( shower stall ) to a temperature that would allow you to shower with cool water rather than hot ? how hot would it have to be in the room for DIGIT degree water to be `` nice . '' DIGIT degree ? and since all of the energy used to heat the air in the space would remain in the space/room , would you use less energy to take a comfortable shower doing it that way ?

what 's more general than category theory ? <eos> first there was arithmetic with numerical calculations ( i.e. , one unknown on one side of an equation ) . then algebra with manipulations of variables ( many unknowns anywhere in an equation ) . then systems are studied that differ from ordinary arithmetic but share some of the same properties ( equations where the unknowns represent all sorts of things - even functional equations ) and then these properties are abstracted in abstract algebra and whole classes are studied such as groups and rings . then category theory studies maps between structures ( functorial equations ) , then n-category theory , then ... where do we go now ? is category theory the end of the road for the foreseeable future ? is the only way forward to go backwards and generalize in a different direction ( like `` generalized equations '' of optimization or something ) ?
semi-decidable problems with linear bound <eos> take a semi-decidable problem and an algorithm that finds the positive answer in finite time . the run-time of the algorithm , restricted to inputs with a positive answer , can not be bounded by a computable function . ( otherwise we ’ d know how long to wait for a positive answer . if the algorithm runs longer than that we know that the answer is no and the problem would be solvable . ) my question is now : can such an algorithm still have a , say , a run-time bound linear ( polynomial , constant , ... ) in the input size , but with an uncomputable constant ? or would that still allow me to decide the problem ? are there example ?

does heavy lifting affect steadiness and precision ? <eos> i do a fair amount of weightlifting ; in particular heavy compound lifts power-lifting style . i also compete on a target pistol team . over the years , i 've heard a number of coaches and marksmen recommend that serious shooters stay away from heavy lifting because it could affect arm stability/precision when holding the pistol . the physical requirement for this sport is to be able to hold a DIGIT lb pistol ( with one hand/arm only ) at arm 's length with elbow locked as steady as possible for DIGIT secs . so my question : are these two sports at odds ? can someone give an explanation for why heavy lifting might ( or might not ) compromise my ability to hold the pistol as steady as i could if i did n't lift ?

why do some diesel engines run on diesel fuel and others on fuel oil ? <eos> trucks and smaller vehicles with diesel engines run on diesel fuel which looks more or less like kerosene - less flammable than gasoline , low viscosity liquid . however larger diesel engines like this DIGIT thousand horsepower marine engine have more or less the same design but use fuel oil which looks very different from diesel fuel - much higher viscosity and i 'd guess igniting fuel oil at room temperature is a challenge . how does it happen that engines of the same design use two different fuels ? if one of them is superior to the other then why wo n't they all stick to that superior fuel ?
